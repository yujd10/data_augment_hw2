Three stories, XX (forgotten), lakeside, goodbye. I was a bit dizzying at first, but later I found it was a relatively independent segment. The last part of the kiss between Chen Bolin and Jiang Wenli can't stand to look straight in the eyes! The title of the film is too hypocritical, and the content is a bit. Not even here? What do you mean?
