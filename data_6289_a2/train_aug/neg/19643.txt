2.5 Titanic 5 doesn't need to watch the top at all, although it's published a little bit, but there's still a problem when the disaster happens. Only the right Tang Dawei character line from Takeshi Kaneshiro can dig deeper. Yamei Nagazawa lives in memory of the special effects of 5 Mao. I don't know what the Huang Song line has wasted time on top. The director can't control this kind of film.
