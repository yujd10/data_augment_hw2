If these actors don't stay here but change their faces, no one will look at it and not feel enthusiastic and inspiring. The drama of Youjiang almost made me forget my love of the knot. I saw a movie review saying that the protagonists of Western films are the best at first, while the protagonists of Eastern films start in full-low mode. Western films win the world and get lost, while Oriental films find themselves and abandon the world.
