I always thought that I was watching the movie of the corpse and thinking about "Pusan Walk", but I didn't expect unscrupulous merchants and demons to ally with each other. It was deeply harmful to the hearts of the locals. The catchy words of the film were that the friends singing in Linlin were very happy. They added a lot of points to the film, and they had a good life at the end.
