What is it? Technology is good, but it's completely different! A few days ago, I saw a film called "Dignity Colony" with Emma Watson. It was a perverted story that took place in Chile during the Nazi period, similar to a concentration camp. And Wolf's Nest tells the history of the colony of dignity! It's just that the technique was filmed in the form of animated clay and so on. Maybe it's the first horror cartoon I've ever seen in my life. The use of technology is at its peak, but it's extremely boring as a whole.
