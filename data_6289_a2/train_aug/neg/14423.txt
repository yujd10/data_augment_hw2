The secret order of a gentleman. It sounds better! Ah, the script that Gai wrote when he had diarrhea. The plot of the characters is so boring. What is more fatal is that speaking English with too many strange accents affects the impression. Even the soundtrack is not very good. Will there be a second movie? Why do you hide so many details at the end of the movie? There is something wrong with casting. Illya doesn't look like a powerful and violent monster.
