Even if it is drawn from a real event, the lines are too bad. Explosion Bay now the war scene always shows a smell of "Transformers", recalling the past "rock-shattering", how powerful, and look at this one, please don't compare it with "Black Hawk Down". No matter the plot or reality of the scene is very different, okay?
