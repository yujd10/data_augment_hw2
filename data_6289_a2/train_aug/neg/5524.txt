I didn't like the Japanese fantasy in the first place. I set it up for Jun Inoue. I didn't expect it or I couldn't help it. It's also the kind that made a lot of adjustments that are completely useless and useless, like being asked by the author with a knife to see if my vision of the world is grandiose or not. Okay, you're tall, so you spend most of your time letting the character do things that don't need these adjustments at all? The film is essentially animated by adjustments, the character can't stand up like paper, every weeping scene is too stiff for empathy, and even worsens the disaffection of the character. It's a pity that Jun Inoue painted on horseback.
