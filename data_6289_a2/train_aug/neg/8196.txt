Everything has two sides, and the correct control of the Soviet Union over socialist politics in the ideology in the film is really disgusting. But the use by the West of various media (radio, newspapers, etc.) to encourage a class of students to engage in political activities is even more frightening, not to mention the fact that these students are still immature. It is better to watch less of this kind of film with a serious political orientation.
