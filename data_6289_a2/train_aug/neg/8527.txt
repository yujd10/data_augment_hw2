It's too boring, the whole boring adventure without waves and then continue to make cold jokes, the performances of the two protagonists are not at all online, like an unfunny (female spy) with bad special effects. There is no scene that makes you nervous or stirs you. What is the age, and take a monster plus a two-minute black hole like the ultimate war? As soon as Remnison appeared on the stage, he wanted to tell you that he was going to end up being a bad guy. Well, I think he fell asleep for several periods.
