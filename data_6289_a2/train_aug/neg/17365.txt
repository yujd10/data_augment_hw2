I knew IMAX for the first time, but I met a remake so unfounded. The event is the same as Spider-Man's first film online, but weaker than the first one in terms of actor, rhythm and plot. It's originally a low-key commercial product, but it seems so thin and cheap when you think of Batman at the same time.
