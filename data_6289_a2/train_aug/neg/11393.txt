It was out of control from beginning to end, rocking at will, without rhythm at all. Horror comedy is the climax, zombies, trials below the world, is the feelings of the old film of Hong Kong, but it is the end of the plot is really empty, everyone is pompous and pretentious to act, as if he were forced to continue with the movie. It was embarrassing all the time, and it wasn't until Shen so I started laughing.
