The plot ruined 007. It is not a problem to pass 007 from God to man. It is the problem of the director to let him go from God to a loser. The long-term conversation is boring, and the fight is basically nothing new. The splendour of the background in Shanghai has transcended the fight. The whole feeling is a film made by a Western cowboy director. 007 has no essence at all.
