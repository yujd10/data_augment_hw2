The war scene is extremely disappointing, and the contradictions between Tokugawa, the cheap Yue Party and Ishida are mentioned roughly at the same time, but they focus on the description of village flowers that claim to be dogs and 30% of alternative love stories. If you have so much time to shoot this bullshit, you might as well add it to the Fuji battle. The name does not match. Passersby who do not know Japanese history think that 30% of the people watch this movie well.
