The story of a poor and boring linguist helping a beautiful flower girl. I thought it would be very interesting, but it turned out to be very noisy, and it was really super noisy. The story of the old film unfolds slowly and is not very adapted to the rapid rhythm of modern times. Even if we look at it twice as fast, it does not look good.
