I didn't read the introduction. As soon as I saw the beginning that Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the communist chan Holocaust revolution, I knew what kind of film it was. As a person who has the ability to think independently, I mean: bullshit. My grandfather went to the battlefield of the northeast and war to resist American aggression and aid Korea. Although he survived the battlefield, what gong gave in the end? bastards without shame, total party. Discredit Chiang Kai-shek? Film bullshit.
