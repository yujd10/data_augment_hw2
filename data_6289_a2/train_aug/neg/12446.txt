The suspense of this film is too weak. At first, it was presented that the male master had fought against death for many years to guess if he had set a trap for the judge to let him die recklessly. When he discussed with the mayor at one and three places and mentioned that there were no cases of unjust death, I almost thought that the writer was digging a hole for the public, trying to guide the great reversal at the end. When day 2 found the female partner with leukemia, he clearly showed that the map was clear.
