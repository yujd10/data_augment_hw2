I have never seen such an embarrassing movie of Galaxy du Cannon. The script fears and wants to show a state of anxiety and high pressure, but it is not well done and the end is completely cracked. The character of Zhong Hanliang is demonized, but it is very counter-natural in the film. To make things worse, the supporting roles of Lu Haipeng, Lin Xue and Xie Tianhua derive from the plot, simply copying the roles of the previous films.
