To quote the egg: Clint Eastwood could have the biggest dare on America. It is indeed quite legendary, but the non-war scenes are filmed too! It's hard! Look! A woman and a child with more background than background. But Sniper's part is so cool, the confirmed murders are more than 160. In the last shot, I don't even see where the other sniper is. Bradley Cooper is so bad.
