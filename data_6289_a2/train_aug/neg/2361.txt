Today, it's October 1, 2019. I watched this film again inadvertently, and it was interspersed with the military parade. At first, I thought there was Stephen Chow, but I didn't expect it to be GE Minghui, alas. GE Minghui is not as funny as Zhou Xingchi. If he hadn't been for Wu Mengda, Lin Guobin, Qiu Shuzhen, Donnie yen, and Shi Xiaolong, they would have been extinct long ago! The actor Wang Jing wanted at that time couldn't get past Zhou Xingchi. It's really Zhou Xingchi for a century. Alas, it's a shame that there's no one who can succeed Zhou Xingchi!
