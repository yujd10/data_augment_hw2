In the British film forever, I saw a model like Sean Bean kissing Caravaggio, ah, you're making fun of me? you want to be so corrupt? it's really Sean Bean. And the queen of ice cream. I don't like this movie. Pure art artists, like painters, often do it in movies. Another example is Kim Kidd, a sculptor.
