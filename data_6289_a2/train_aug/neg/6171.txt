I thought the wall was rotten to the extreme. I never thought there was more noise. I think the innovative comedy dialogue is pretty good, but this evil heroine, how your face, which is bitterer than the balsam pear, corresponds to our beautiful and virtuous white lady? With all due respect, I really don't see how you fell in love with Xu Xian at all. There is no bedding and details at all. Isn't it a love movie? Even if you can't make a good love movie, what can you say?
