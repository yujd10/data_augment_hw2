Real people + political conspiracy theory + topical ethics + drugs + public opinion, a good theme is ruined by the blender routine model. There are usually two ways of this kind of theme, either to focus on the evolution of the situation, or to focus on the representation of the protagonist's image, but this film has nothing to do with the other. The director thought he was smart enough to put in many meaningless plots in an attempt to make the story more complete, only to get two hours of pins and needles.
