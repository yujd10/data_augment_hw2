Is it necessary to remake? The comics group said that the Chinese language GET lines were completely inferior to G-point, and I was lazy to say that the Japanese version was not good enough to read the original comics, but the director was very intelligent, but he was just smart. I thought he was going to shoot a few new tricks, but in fact he was just localized. In his sense, he imitated only the boring works of the past and told those who watched the film for the first time that the subject was bold and ridiculous.
