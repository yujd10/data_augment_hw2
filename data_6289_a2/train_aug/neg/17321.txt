The film has the taste of Hong Kong's first gangster films, and we can feel that Wang Jing intends to imitate Johnnie, but it's a shame that there aren't many new ideas, and the filming technique is also very different from that of Lao. The story is too old, and the end has already guessed that if you can only compare the film with Wang Jing herself, I love Chen Xiaochun, who is the best actor, and can remember the role he played. In recent years, Hong Kong films must be said to show a retrograde trend. There has been no amazing Hong Kong movie since Infernal Affairs.
