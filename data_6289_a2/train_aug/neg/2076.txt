I haven't seen such a bad video in a long time, which is worse than the classroom homework shot by many of my classmates. It's very inexplicable. No one talks and the behavior is normal, and the plot is squarely like cheap plastic. A star, to the big banyan tree and the walking road near the Pearl River. It's not a good blow either.
