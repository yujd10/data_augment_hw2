I thought it was said that ghosts were not allowed, why was it that "what hell" come out? In fact, I'm quite curious (but also out of curiosity to see if it's really bad), why this kind of bad film can persist in shooting without shame until now. From the plot to actor's talents are fascinated, next to Wu Laoer to be able to hold the camera can be better than him, a bunch of sluts schagging, bad to themselves and finally can't make a success, it's shit.
