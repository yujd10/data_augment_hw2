Although a movie doesn't only suck because of a person, but I still hope that Lu Han, if you don't like to play, don't force yourself. You don't have to play every day until the early hours of the morning. You really disrespect the film industry and make people you love to play feel. I think you can quit. Really, don't you want to have a second child anyway? Have a good discussion with Xiaotong. Don't go out to harm the audience. Thank you.
