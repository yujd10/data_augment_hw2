This Snow White is too old and ugly, and dare say that she is the most beautiful woman in the world! Compared to the original Disney, the dwarfs are not cute, and the dialogue between the prince and the princess is even more disgusting! The whole film still wants to amuse the public, but for me there is no point of laughing at all. I meant that this is the worst American animation I've ever seen, but I didn't expect to take a look at it.
