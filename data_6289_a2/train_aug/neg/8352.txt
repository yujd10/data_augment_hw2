"Pancake Man" as an egg of color out to reap a wave of feelings on her, insatiably save a film to make another profit, too disrespectful of the public's IQ. This bowl of cold rice is not only stagnant, but also insufficient. What about Jiao Pi and Zhu Yongtang? This is a typical piece of mediocre and boring works created under the mentality of speculative creation. The story is extremely boring, and the motivation of the characters is like "delivering to the country" in the film of grave-digging, which finally becomes the most boring look put by people at that time. Why do you have so many fragmented flashbacks when you can tell the previous story of a character in a minute? Stealing and stealing deck segments are all kinds of imitations, and the car-chasing explosions taken by people at the time.
