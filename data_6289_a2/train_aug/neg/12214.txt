Hollywood films always refresh my expectations for human technology, such as the widespread penetration of information technology into the life presented in the 1998 "public enemy of the nation." The same applies in the first half of the film, but the second half is suddenly transformed into science fiction, all kinds of logical wounds, the plot is unreasonable, even if the production of images is still good, it cannot save the fate of being reduced to a third order job.
