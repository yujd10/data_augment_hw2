The story is always chaotic, the story has almost no frame to talk about, and there is a lack of ignition. OST is really good, and the two stages of Superman's appearance are super good. Flash was the best player in the game, followed by Superman, and other performances, including Batman and Wonder woman, were somewhat unsatisfactory.
