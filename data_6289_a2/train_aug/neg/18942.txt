There are big problems with the respective settings of the Iron Triangle and the relationship between each other and the progression of the plot. Many nanny plots are forced to enter it without knowing how to use it, and there is a lack of decent high points. I think it really makes no sense for this film to be filmed under the name of anti-drug.
