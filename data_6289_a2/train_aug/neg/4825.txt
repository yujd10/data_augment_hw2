Understand a truth: as long as the script is bad enough, even if the goddess has stripped herself so many times, there is no interest for her; it is believed that only those who have read the novel can understand the film. Amar'e Stoudemire is not worth removing for such a play, and his figure is really bad. It is better to wear leather pants.
