The plot is too thin, the content of the image is empty, resulting in a very boring development, slow of the plot, narrative only for the narrative, clumsy! It is like the ambition to transform the first 15 minutes of Space Odyssey 2001 into an epic. It is a long way away. I do not expect to see a good film in the cinema, at least not too boring!
