It's too hot. Completely missed to live up to expectations, although the jewels shot very beautiful, but I don't watch any jewelry film, it shouldn't be a warm collection of female thieves? Everyone, yes, I said that each of this flight crew has no special features. The only thing that can be a little bit is the role of Hathaway, but she's still a half-monk thief, so she's very sad and doesn't like it.
