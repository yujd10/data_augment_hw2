I don't know exactly what the plot is in the original cartoon, but this animation is really bad. Certainly, its age is relatively early, and it's understandable that it can't compare with today's animation for technical reasons, but the screenwriter and the split objective aren't. We can see that many important scenes in the film are skipped directly, without sincerity, probably to save money, and the screenwriter really can't find the focus when managing the plot. To take a simple example, the Huang Mao Bichi was made in one specimen. Did the author explain why? She is a doctor in the base city only in Eddard, who can help the factory manager maintain his field of combat and give the herb from the factory manager, the most important thing is that the false promise to her is far from the day that must be fulfilled, and it is necessary to find a homeless person to make a specimen. Is it necessary to use such a useful object?
