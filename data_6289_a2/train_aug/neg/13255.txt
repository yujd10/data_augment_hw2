After eight to nine films, I almost removed the powder. Don't brag about your feelings with me. Just make a good film and leave it to others to pay tribute to you. When Quentin's films rely on the blowing of their feelings to win their eyeballs, it will be cold. Barely saved by the last half hour, however, the only effective plot of the film was driven by narration. I almost suspected that the film was not made by Quentin, after all, his captivating narrative ability was the heart of his violent aesthetics.
