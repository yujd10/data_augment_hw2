Dan Maze, who directed the films of Sarah Cohen, is directed by Dan Maze, so it is not surprising that the role of Niro basically continues the model of the "family of gangsters", then it goes in the same direction in "good guys". In fact, I think this kind of role is the climax of de de Niro. The setting of the first half of the film should be more sufficient, and it starts to be shaped in the last step. Of course, there are also some funny scattered points, but the degree is still low.
