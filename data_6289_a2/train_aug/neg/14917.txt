Without the thriller brought by them jumping and jumping as soon as they arrived, but the unpleasant story is also quite stinking and long, flashing back at the crime scene can be repeated to an attack. I hope the ferocious detective will play an important role in promoting the incident after coming out, but it doesn't seem to be either. I was forced to pick up a scapegoat at the end of the quick look. I don't understand why the score is so high. Who can tell me about it?
