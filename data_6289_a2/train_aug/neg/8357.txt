A romantic comedy as inexpensive, mentally retarded and incompetent is a dead comedy. Can't write good stories, can't find good ideas, can't create new kinds of Chinese romance films that can't expand, and doesn't help industrialization backwards of China. If this group of talented creators puts all their mind on this kind of film in the future, it will come true if they've been dumped by South Korea for ten years. At this time when the media have the right to talk, it's so fair to use the paragraph to throw eggs again.
