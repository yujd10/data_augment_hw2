Like a thriller, most of them are routines of decades ago, and I'm bored when I don't watch a lot of horror movies; like a suspensive film, there's no logic, and the clowns' patterns are really disconcerting; they're OK as an educational film, but their parents' images are a little facial, and these kids aren't growing up too fast? It's like he's suddenly overcome his fear... I wish it was so easy.
