I don't think anyone who has studied the history of the warring states can swallow it. In the trailer, the second disease exploded, and I dared to watch the positive film. I admire myself. Not to mention the high configuration of the clothes and the label, but this production is really shoddy, the plot is also a child with the drama of extreme fan idols, the interpretation skills are all based on screams. The level of production is comparable to that of the online domestic dramas. I want to see the Qin Empire wash my eyes.
