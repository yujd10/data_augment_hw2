In 2014, "the beginning of spring" gave a star to Zhang Luyi. I want to make a film of a great era, but I find that the farce that really consumes fashion is not made by the so-called filmmakers. The dream to become famous is really the biggest fishing net, killing how many dogs drifters from Beijing in a pocket. The dream is crushed in a stone depraved by everyone on the side of the road, but the reality is to let others still believe in dreams when they are old. What boring story mixed with the bad water of many twisted doors became a box office legend. Court, App.
