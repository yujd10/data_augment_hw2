The plot is so thin that a hero who doesn't make sense like other heroes doesn't have a future. Even if the last deliberate supplement is too late, but seems to be abrupt. The end is out of the air with the previous one, so we might as well kill a hero. How much Ang Lee wanted to live in Hollywood, did he take that kind of book?
