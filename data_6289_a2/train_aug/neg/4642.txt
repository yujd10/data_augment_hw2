A star in the image, a group of people get confused, deliberately managing the feeling of inferiority, but there is no sense of innocence, and it's very boring. No, no, no, no, no, no. Now I can't believe Douban's score. Douban's so-called high-level literary film becomes increasingly unreliable. In my opinion, this film is worth only one star.
