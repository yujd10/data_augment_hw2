I don't understand why I gave this article such a high score on the Internet. In fact, it's a successful autobiography of a boring and cotettish man. The successful experience of the man is familiar to everyone, so it's not attractive, but the key is that the film is not very well done. Seeing the high score of 8.3 on Douban, I can't help wondering what you can see on this play.
