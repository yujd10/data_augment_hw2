I don't think it plays an important role in the emotional drama in the film. On the contrary, I think it can allow us to understand the lives of great people of all aspects, but is it too superficial to trigger the love of great people with the background of the idol drama? I have always felt that the real feelings emanating from the heart cannot be shown by the splendour of the background, but the actors' acting skills should be paired with the appropriate scenes, while this play is mainly counter-invited. And the hostess is too small Jasper, it is rare.
