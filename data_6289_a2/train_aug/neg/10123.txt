European and American film Japanese Fan-Repression. It's a standard Douban film, young literary and artistic people flock to it. Once the pain occurs, it must be kept in your heart forever, then expressed slowly and contained in a two-hour film. Of course, you can't cry bitterly, otherwise how can you be a literary youth? It must be a loss of face all the time, it must be a kind of frigidity that no one can tease. I don't deny that there is a pain that can't be overcome. I just think that this film is deliberately hypocritical.
