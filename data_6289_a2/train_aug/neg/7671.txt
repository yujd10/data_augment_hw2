1. The plot is extremely procrastinate, and the dramatic conflict is 0%. The sense of the mirror is very poor, visual fatigue, making people sleep; 3. The extreme failure of characterization makes me more disgusted with the people of this nation. Does the director want to express class differences? Satirize the peasants? The display effect is relatively poor; 5. I have finished watching it again in a second, and the experience of the film was really bad. This film is really overrated.
