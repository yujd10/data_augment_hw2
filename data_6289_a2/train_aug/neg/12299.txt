It is said that the flip-card is in fact a copy of the location of the continent, but whether it is the meeting of Dillon with Brother Fage after his release from prison, or the part of the wine house of Fage, this film does not copy the feeling of the classical scene of the classic film of 1984. Moreover, the story added in this edition seems totally superfluous. Apart from the songs of my brother and the pigeons of John Woo, there is really nothing left in this film.
