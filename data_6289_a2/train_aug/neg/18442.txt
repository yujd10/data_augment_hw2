I opened and watched this film about three times, and finally finished it at the strong demand of my husband. I don't know why I didn't use the film. I was used to the weak tone. I thought it was the wrong format, and then I fell asleep the first two times. Of course, the third time I still remember the end, dear John died deliberately.
