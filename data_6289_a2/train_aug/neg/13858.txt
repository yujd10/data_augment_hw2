This score... Tut-tut, really beautiful, it's justice, originally wanted to give a pass for this kind of show-off talent that Skerwell always liked (you see, we can now show our teeth to this point, what, didn't see clearly? It's okay. Look at it a few more times. Come on.), seeing that the score is so wrong, it's better to remember the two hours I wasted.
