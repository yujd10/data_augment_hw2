There is no perseverance after watching it three times. After the fast advance, the story is rotten, there are many technical problems, and there are many characters, but there is no three-dimensional character. One can see that the director is so fooled that he can make a cop and a bandit who needs blood and film so mediocre, that there is no scene, no love, and the character's motive is still so stupid.
