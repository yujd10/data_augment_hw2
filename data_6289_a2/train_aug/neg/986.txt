Does this mean that the mention of "the confusion of youth" in the film is equivalent to "the combination of two men (a thin and a fat) and a woman + riding the train + drinking and smoking + messing in the wind + getting into the sun"? This kind of formalism, which is unwilling to use any brain to observe life, applies mechanically and does everything it needs, which is unbearable to me.
