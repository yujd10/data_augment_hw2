The action films with imperfect structures lose too much time in Marco Wahlberg's soliloque. First, I wondered why so much time was lost during the raid, and later explained why. At the same time, if we look at the film from a neutral point of view, it is a typical act of revenge. A group of teams paid the price for what they did. There are two great problems: the escort task is not pure, and the action of combat and shooting is inconsistent. Too much lens change creates a feeling of irreality, and the second text is that the whole story wants to do both, but without success. Moreover, the reason for finding a special unit on the Russian line is not clear. Finally, it is not perfect that the operation team and central control center have been destroyed because of the shooting of the hero, who is not dead.
