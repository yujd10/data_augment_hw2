1.5 stars. I forgot to comment on it. By commenting on the Great Buddha, I am thinking of the unilateral analysis of conventional labels of film ideas and movie reviews, and think of the negative examples of Indian films, which are more representative of "my God" and of this "fight". Not to love Indian films, have balls. Good, but not good enough. The feeling is good at first sight, but the idea is simple and there is no aftertaste. It is actually very lame.
