I watched it for half an hour the night before and the rhythm was too slow to give up. Today, I kept waiting for an 8.6-point film and the highly recommended wait by my university friends. I watched patiently for more than two hours, but there was no answer! There is no answer! I'm going crazy! I can't appreciate any technique of art or shooting. I want answers! I want to know who did it!
