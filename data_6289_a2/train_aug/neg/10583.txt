Another disappointing stereotyped Olympic bid film, retro atmosphere to create a promotional film of the U.S. Immigration Service very hard and animated, the plot is simple without any twist, but the last part is extremely unconvincing. The relationship between heroin and Gao Fu Shuai is simply too inexplicable, and the motivation to promote heroin to return to the United States is even more distant. In fact, I do not know how superficial it is to express the aspirations of this generation of immigrants.
