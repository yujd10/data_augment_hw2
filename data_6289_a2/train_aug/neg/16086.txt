Now, look how ridiculous the call to this film was to make it enter the prize season. Taking the road to the biography means that the protagonist needs something to talk about in the past, but in fact, everyone has seen it, but it's not. 90 minutes are barely survived by night clubs and bars. It's understandable that the heroes themselves will inevitably play amateurs, but what I don't understand is that all the production is very amateur. I would rather believe that Dongmu is just a name.
