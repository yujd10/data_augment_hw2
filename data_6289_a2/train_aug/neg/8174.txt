After watching this film, I don't want to see Huang Xiaoming's film and television anymore. His acting skills have deteriorated considerably over the years. Zhuo Yihang has the feeling of playing Wei Xiaobao. Maybe the script is also old-fashioned, really disgusting, reading regrets, a waste of time.
