I don't feel impressed at all. The rhythm is sometimes stiff, and the image is sometimes rough. The music is also dull. Current biographical stories have no imagination, how much is the reflection of human beings on nature and society? I am voiceless as a fan. It is much worse than the strength of "Red Pig".
