Love for love of love movies, always cannot accept the Reese Witherspoon, Patrick Dempsey is the reason why I keep watching it. To climb the tree, the woman tried hard to get rid of the skin of her "servant" and wanted to have a relationship with her childhood husband. I know that after a long trip, I'm back to know this man and this Sweet Home, VS Alabama, city and village, gold and true love, for me, I'm going to love?
