I thought it was an action film. Therefore, I didn't expect the plot to be boring. I don't like Owen when I look more closely. Well, remember who the main actor is before watching the movie next time. But like Tom Tykwer's shooting method, the structure of the scene is as beautiful as ever, full of tension, but full of cold and desolation.
