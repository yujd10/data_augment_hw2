It's as if every character was mentally retarded. Seeing that the devil didn't run away, he had to get out of the car and take a look at the head. The protagonist's family is hidden in the basement, don't make a sound ah, don't call the police (think that none of the protagonist's family has a mobile phone), must shoot upstairs to expose the location. After the enchanted weapon rolled in the stairs, the protagonist didn't fix the knife, but directly threw the gun on the demon to run. It's all the fancy intelligence. It's the worst movie I've seen in recent years, and it's logically broken. Finally, I strongly recommend that everyone go see it. I can't suffer alone!
