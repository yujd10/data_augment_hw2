The plot has been mentally retarded from the beginning. How could a survival challenge of the high-end Reality Show be put down without first discovering that the so-called Montagnards actually have the same home as human beings and have all kinds of daily necessities? How did you get these things? Now that we can get it, we will not be far from human civilization. How can a Montagnard family avoid the sight of human beings? The plot of 1-6 films is not absurd. There are 6 films so bad. I really want to beat the screenwriters and the directors.
