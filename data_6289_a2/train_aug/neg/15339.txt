The aesthetics of the low-level film, the bad directing skills, the overall texture is completely a television film, or a relatively ordinary genre. Three hours of the duration of the plot is free, do not leave empty and after-taste no chance, do not see how many real feelings, only constantly sensational music and tears. As for the deliberate repentance of the wicked, the plot that the good and bad end up kissing and understanding each other is stupid, especially when it comes to one of the worst policies in human history, I cannot understand what a director would like to do when it comes to the valley.
