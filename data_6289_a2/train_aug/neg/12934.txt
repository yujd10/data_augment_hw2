The quality of three and a half stars is deduced because the story is too primary age, and another star is due to dubbing. In fact, most domestic star dubbing is miserable, so it is better to pay less than full-time dubbing like the little prince. Besides, add a half-star to the original, after all, it is rare to have domestic animation films with pure original scripts these days! Finally, I would like to complain about why Emperor Jade has a Hong Kong and Taiwan accent.
