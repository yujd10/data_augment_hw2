I can put up with an undefiled device that is not like what people say, but I can't stand it. I really do a bad job. There are at least three places that are irrational anyway: 1. Lin Yun's password can also be scanned by credit card. 2. Rich people don't have a guest room? 3. Girls move the shadow show on the viaduct of the present. There's no thing like a teenager.
