It was only when I turned the ticket heel that I almost missed this play. The strangest film experience ever seen in the cinema, not to mention the fact that the image is dark, the characters are pitifully rare, and the plot is boring and rotten. Without subtitles, the entire film is removed from the beginning to the end for just over an hour, and it suddenly comes to an end. The audience at the end of the show is completely amazed. It is lucky that the cinema did not get a refund.
