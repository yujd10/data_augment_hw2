As long as you make things clear, it doesn't matter if logic is not so smooth. You can still kill time if you can't get out of Hollywood mode. But what about this body? Frankenstein was bitten by a dead body, Adam, okay? That's the basis of this movie, right? How about a little respect for this frame? The most unbearable thing is "what are you going to do?" take a break from personal heroism. Please!
