A few years ago, because of the forced demolition (no relocation) of urban planning, a group of elderly people who were defenceless by the armed police and then fired them for only a few thousand or tens of thousands, it made me feel cold when I thought about it. This film does not know what ghosts are talking about superpowers, talk about social problems, the story is too weak, and it does not give actors a chance to play. I doubt that they are watching the same film with so many reviews.
