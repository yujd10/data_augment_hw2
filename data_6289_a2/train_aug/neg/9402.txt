This Nima is a horror movie, it's just an improved version of the spoon killer. I really sympathize with the bad guys. If an indestructible fly haunts me all day, I'll kill myself. But compared to the hostess, the bad guy is at least freed early. Do women spend their entire lives with flies? You said you didn't change into a cat or something after your second reincarnation, but it was still a fly, and the hostess enjoyed it, and these songs and dances cursed, I'll never see Indian movies again.
