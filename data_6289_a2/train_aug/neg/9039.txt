Spielberg and Hanks are certainly the best partners, and their film department is relieved that they don't understand the hero's father. After watching the film at 2:00 p.m. on April 22, I learned that Spielberg died on the 19th when I was watching the introduction. Why was there no news before? It's so strange that Baidu's encyclopedia is faster than the news?
