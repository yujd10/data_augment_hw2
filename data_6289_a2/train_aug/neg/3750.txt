At first, I thought it was a film with a rhythm and style similar to that of Leonardo, the Flying Man. The image of this film is old, and I thought it had been downloaded badly, like the image of the 1980s. It's really like a current account, and the plot is not very attractive. After watching it for a few minutes, I don't want to see it.
