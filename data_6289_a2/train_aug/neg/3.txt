Shu Qi is probably too eager to get rid of the idea of "becoming famous as soon as he takes off" that she has always positioned her role in this type of character without any desire to become strong. But she really didn't have the material to play this role, and she wasted her face otherwise sexy. Forgive me for watching this movie because I'm a fan of Zhang Zhen, otherwise I would have missed a star rating.
