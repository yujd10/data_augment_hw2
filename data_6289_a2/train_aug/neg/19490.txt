Hideaki Ueno has been obsessed with a psychoanalytic film about autistic children for so many years, but now that we are all adults, the hero's mind becomes simpler and simpler. It took me three years to make such an absurd film. I began to think that I had a lot of luck seeing Eva and her daughter in high school.
