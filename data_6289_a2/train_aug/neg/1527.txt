To avoid all sorts of realistic conflicts, it's basically about eating and how to prepare for eating. If it can also be called a feature film, how can it be fair for writers who struggle for excellence and work hard to design the plot? Like a documentary ok, like a plot film, a star is too much. It's not the story I've read.
