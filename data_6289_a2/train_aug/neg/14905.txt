The end is desperate and amazing. When I think of the game "Dark Marsh Manor", I thought it was a victory, but in fact, the game just started, or finished. The discussion of human nature is not deep enough. I thought a few people would change sex. More than that is a desperate coincidence, as dominoes, people fall one after the other.
