I feel that the main line is unknown, I feel that the director uses two main lines, one is the emotion and the other is the suspense of the werewolf, and finally he does not know how to combine the two in one. Anyway, it is a disorder in the back. In the end, the details and the main line were completely confused. The director himself may not have understood it.
