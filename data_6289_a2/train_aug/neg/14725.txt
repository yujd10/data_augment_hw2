The show of history did not bring any waiting, it was entirely destined for the image. However, Mr. Zhao, where is your control over the image? What is wrong with the edition of Xu Hongyu (although this piece is badly cut must be the pot of the director)? Not to mention the art, Travel to the West is better than that. How did you make such a beautiful couple so ugly? How did the beautiful scene end up with the texture of this page?
