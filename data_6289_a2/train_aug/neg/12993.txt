Nie Yinniang in the legend of the Tang dynasty is simply dazzling, such an interesting and carefree Luotuo story travel is actually filmed as Confucianism pretending to be wrong, and the character is unattractive and at a loss of what to do. I admit that this story is really only about loneliness, changed in this way, it shows that modern people have put more restrictions than the Tang dynasty, too boring, filmed loneliness in patience and suffering, the director Hou has strayed.
