Well, I'm here to hack. On the first day in Asia, the band came around the money again, and the pseudo-rock label has been affixed to the top right corner of the band since the beginning. This is the first time I've seen a documentary sold in the movies like a movie. I'm really watching it, and there are a lot of stupid fans. Watch the movie review, and Nima has a complete score. That way, the score is supposed to exceed Shawshank's redemption. It's a shame to come out. Theo, Douban how more and more.
