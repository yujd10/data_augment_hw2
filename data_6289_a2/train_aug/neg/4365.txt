No matter who shot it, they're treated the same way, bad movies are bad movies, students with no interpretation skills, humble DV shooting works. Where did Xiao Qingxin get such a high score? You can give bad movies like "Guan Yunchang" and "warring States" for one or two stars, but you can't give that kind of fake technology, fake production, fake actors, the four or five stars. Is that interesting? Who do you pretend to see? Anyway, I'm going to tell you the truth.
