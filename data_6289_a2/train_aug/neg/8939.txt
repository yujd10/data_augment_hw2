Let's be clear about the truth. Image and music are worth five stars. Such an image cannot tell a good story, deduce a star. The writer has created a woman so evil with three values, refusing a star. It is even more disgusting for people to deduce a star from selling their feelings in 3D. Finally, very personally, I watch a film casually in my free time, and it pisses me off. I don't care if I want to deduce another star.
