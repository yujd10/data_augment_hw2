Bad film! Also lost the bag, angry domestic writers (angrily) always consider the public as mentally retarded, insipid as the intrigue of boiled water to add a pile to the side, fear that people cannot understand. The lines are deliberately hypocritical, not literature and art, but forced to pretend, thunder and lightning.
