I went to the cinema the first time when it was published many years ago, and now it's finally the last film. Being insensitive is purely a hobby. I wanted to smoke a director since the order of Phoenix. The wonderful choice of battle in the book was a mess; many important plots were removed and changed inexplicably; 7 Harry paralyzed obviously seized the wood Hawthorn directly by hand and became the master, but in the end he broke it without repairing Phoenix's feather. It seems that the most important thing to cry about is the old baguette.
