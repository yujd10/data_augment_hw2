There is a ghost relationship with Frankenstein, pain and despair give birth to Frankenstein, but only to see the pain of the clumsy and bloody description, ask Ellie Fanning to correspond to a few chapters to convince the audience that it was written by marry Shelley? Besides that if it is a good scenario, I would be so crazy that I would like to drag Ellie Fanning out for a beat. I think the micro-expression she is playing now is extremely suitable for the dog of the heart under the peony flower, playing such a strong, sweet and kind character, who can believe it?
