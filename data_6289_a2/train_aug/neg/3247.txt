After watching it in the cinema today, the general feeling is inexplicable. The story and background are in the second year as Altman. Introduces many characters abruptly without explanation and without presentation. The development of the story is not interesting. The most important thing of this film, if anything, is that it exploded. Tip: if there are other movies you want to see, don't look at that.
