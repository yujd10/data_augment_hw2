As far as history is concerned, it is quite complete and the narration is neat. The pattern is firmly established, and with the clich√© frame of "rememberments are the greatest villains", it is interesting to think of the Innuendo parts of several key love nodes (need to put a question mark). It is a pity that the characters were not created, and it is not enough to rely on the madness and roaring of the body. It has some reference meaning in Chinese tombs flying commercial IP films, and has reservations about performance and visual effects.
