Sporadic. It is simply a depraved story of the destruction by Camille de Rodin, whose sexual dependence has broken out. After Ajiani and Binoche, the new Camille is obviously under too much pressure to perform, but the director Jacques Duvalon prefers, and even the protagonist Rodin can only appear on the side often, completely wasting Vincent Linton's excellence. Everything is like a disaster.
