At first, I was surprised by the peacock. When I saw the end, I don't remember that the peacock was shot by the director. I thought it was another film. The Indian complex of the director is too heavy, and the actress's skills in insipid and nuclear-free theatre are gathered in pieces, but fortunately, he ruined on a good book. Ps:JRM or stop acting in costumes, black circles under the eyes explode zombie face head, casting director, makeup artist doesn't tease, okay?
