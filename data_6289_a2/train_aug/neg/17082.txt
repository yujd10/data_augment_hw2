Kung Fu Panda Sammo Hung fights the two great gangs of China and Russia. More than sensational, lack of endurance, literary drama, as an old woman binds to feet, martial arts are short and without splendor, almost all in the trailer. The director has ideas but does not control enough, and there are too many banalities. It is interesting to see the old faces of Hong Kong movies coming out to speak northeastern dialect. There is too much knowledge, and finally, the eggs are good. 2.5/5
