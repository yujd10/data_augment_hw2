I've finished watching him at dinner. I feel like the whole arrangement is very strange, the heroin is a strange loser, the beautiful hero is strangely in love with her, and the strange thing about soy sauce is that lace still loves heroin, and the whole joke is very strange. Is the legendary British humor like that in chicken movies. It's not that we didn't see death at the funeral, nor were we cold enough to laugh. Anyway, after watching it, we're speechless.
