I find that my current political position often oscillates from one side to the other. I'm just watching bad movies like "back". I really think that such a straight view of history is really TMD. This very vulgar, sad and powerless vision of the story conveyed by this film makes me have almost no sympathy for the tragic suffering of the characters in the play. Well, I think it's because I read Nietzsche recently.
