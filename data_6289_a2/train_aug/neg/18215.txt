The film Transformers has grown up in the animation of children, and this film has again become a film for children. The plot is childish, adapted to children under 18 years of age, at the same level as "Monster truck", with childhood scars, saving the world and old routines to get together. no, no, no. Black teenagers have no action skills and even have a simple expression. When King Kong fights, they feel that human beings are really superfluous, especially heroin is more superfluous, and she always wants to get involved. In short, the special effects are good, the plot is childish, and there is nothing to say about it as a whole.
