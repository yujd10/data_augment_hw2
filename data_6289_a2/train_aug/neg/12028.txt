I haven't read a novel, but I think a novel will be better than a movie. Many long-range scenes in the film are very grand, with all the main lines around square wood and other very thin characters. As far as actor skills are concerned, Deng Chao is well maintained and Ruan Chaochang plays. Although Miss Liu can see that she is trying to act, she is still at the bottom. The love piece between man and woman is good. Liu Shishi is an actress who dissipates my love to act every time I love her in my life.
