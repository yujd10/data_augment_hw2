Rubbish! It doesn't look good at all. Even if it's such a bad movie, it can get 8 points? Do you have to give 8 points to those who resist in Japan? Is it true that people who give 8 points have been poisoned by demons in hand for so long that even movies that are not usually beautiful can get high marks? This film cannot get 5.7 points at most! The price must have been bought by some people who have spent a lot of money. Only Schindler list shoes!
