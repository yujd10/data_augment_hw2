A star is for Xu Qing. This film gives people a sense of monetary fraud. The killer's beautiful image has been tarnished. The story is bad, full of mistakes, and meaningless. Finally, Joe says a monologue, "mothers will sacrifice themselves to protect their children, men will cry to save their wives *" I thought there was a truth I hadn't realized. Think about it. It's still out of date. Pseudo-science fiction. I watched it after I was asleep.
