Giving two stars is the last tenderness. The routine is very steep, the soundtrack, the plot and the lines are really indescribable, and you can't pull out a drop of crocodile tears after looking at it. Do not brag that it is comparable to the mission of Hachi and a dog, do not love strangers and flageller on strangers, one can only say that the narrative ability of domestic directors is really poor.
