As an entertainment comedy meets the criteria of passage, the complete characters of the story are fundamentally unannoyed. Although it takes the form of the "game" of "who is serious first and who loses first" as a series, in the end it still returns to the "main theme" of "feelings really need to pay". Only confession at the end adds to the hypocrisy of domestic dramas. This story is reborn from a South Korean film.
