In the first scene, the heroine was wrong, and there was no mystery in the original work; it was even worse for her fianc√© to really love her, and it was in this world that she fell into the abyss step by step; the final arrest and suicide were voiceless, and there was plenty of room for the imagination for the original work to rest on her shoulder; and the main critical consumerism of the original work was completely removed? Aunt Miyabe will probably be furious when she sees it.
