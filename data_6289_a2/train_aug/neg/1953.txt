I didn't like the film. I was impatient. The heroine is very confused, and the film process doesn't grow. Can we really burn the past to make you leave the past and become the new yourself? Will she be more confident if she has the chance to meet the first friend she can talk to? Finally, I can't accept myself, can I not? It's not youth. A star gives the positive energy that the film tries to bring to the public (but doesn't bring much).
