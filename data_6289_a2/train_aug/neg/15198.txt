There are a lot of inconsistencies between on9 and TWIST, but this type of TWIST player needs a copy of LOGIC. Otherwise, people can also write about it and don't have enough effort to promote the provocation of "human nature." No, no, no. The reasoning is high again. And the editing is also very bad. This position is really funny.
