Let's say it this way, except for Shen Teng's movies, everything else is hot. Huang Cailun has become disgusting when I see him. Chang Yuan essentially belongs to the type of not watching him. Allen, I hope you don't let me down. I'm a little afraid to watch your movies now. I'm afraid you're becoming another Huang Cailun to my impression. Heroes, take good care of your comedies or your plays.
