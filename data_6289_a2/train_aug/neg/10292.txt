Routines and tricks are not new at all. I can guess the end from the beginning, and I have a good sense of rhythm, but it is not difficult to put such a story of unique mind. The drama of love is the best in trilogy, and some of the clich√©s have an impact, and the rest is a collection of all kinds of stereotypes, but it is very in line with the habits of appreciation of "Chinese", and some nostalgic things connect me.
