Lars von Trier is committed to rebelling against the current habits of reading films of contemporary human beings, and to completely removing the "pleasure" in the viewing experience. It is really, really difficult, to make a film "powerful". As a director, the magnification of emotion is original sin. Without sensation, extreme mental suffering is liberated at any time through an unbalanced objective. His characters are miserable, and we are even more unhappy.
