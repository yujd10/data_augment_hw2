It took almost two strokes and three minutes to go to the grave, then became close to science in a second. This Laura is simply stupid and willing and selfish, with low combat efficiency and looking for trouble. She can sacrifice the world to save her father. In the end, she can run to draw a ladder and die with the bad guys. There are too many procrastinate and useless plotting and inexplicable fighting scenes throughout the film. Daniel Wu is a real passerby.
