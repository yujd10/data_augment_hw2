Recently always looking at the living room, twelve angry men, the perfect stranger, this man is from the earth. A group of people chattered in a room for more than an hour, but compared to the first two books, the earth really does not interest me. The knowledge of history books is really boring. Why people are always angry about things they can't understand.
