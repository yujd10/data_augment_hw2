I gave up when I saw India. In this paragraph in Shanghai, I understood only one sentence from Shanghainese, but I did not understand the other phrases "Chinese", and I felt that the scene was so false. Besides, the part in India feels even more incredible, and I don't want to watch it, the first film I can't watch in 2014.
