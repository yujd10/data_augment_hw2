Visual wonders and combat designs are incredible! But this suffocating plot only hates Douban without a negative score. It is understandable that the director thinks that the audience likes to watch cool scenes, but how can there be empathy even if the motivation of the character's behavior is blurred or contradictory? If this film sells well, will there be more things that burn carefully to the mixed scissors and use the feet for rainbow characters and treat the audience as a mentally handicapped? I was so afraid that I quickly played a star.
