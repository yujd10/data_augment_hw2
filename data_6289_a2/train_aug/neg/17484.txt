Thirteen years later, the special effects are still not shy, which is commendable. But the reason why the hero doesn't like robots is too much, and the kind of human chauvinism in the second half of the film makes me very uncomfortable too. Robots can't hurt human beings, you robots will certainly hurt human beings, robots don't hesitate to kill the same kind for human beings, especially the third point, if the robot is replaced by a dog, it should be scolded to death. Why are you such great humans? Why don't you go to heaven?
