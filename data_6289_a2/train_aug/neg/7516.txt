Perverted, grotesque, ugly, without beauty. The rhythm is slow. The heroine is ugly. The masked fabric stamped with a circuit enters the hearts of others through wiring devices, treats the little schizophrenic boy, and tries to learn where the victim of the psychopath killer is. Talking with a whispering tone is unbearable. "I am in charge of my territory" is funny. The final result is that the spy finds a symbol of the heart of the killer and deduces the location of the victim to be successfully saved.
