There is no reason to laugh in the whole process, the stems are very low and naive, which fell to the ground and so on. This made me realize that the cartoons are finally for the children. Then I started to worry about watching the animation of these boring children with my children in the future, instead of cats and mice full of wisdom and real humor. Finally, my 3D glasses were broken, and I didn't have to go out to change them. I was naked and finished without obstacles. 95% of the plot didn't need 3D.
