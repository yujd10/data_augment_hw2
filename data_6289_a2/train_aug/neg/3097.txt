I think the time of the Yellow Emperor was barbaric, bloody, cruel, tribal slaughter, struggle for territory, and the dawn of civilization appeared. I feel that the film is barbaric and bloody, the actors are not wild enough, and the thought of modern theme has penetrated into this era, which is boring.
