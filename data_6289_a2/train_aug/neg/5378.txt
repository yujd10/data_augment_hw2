I've seen this film at least 3 times (the content of the first 40 minutes), the last time is to watch with a person, this last content has never been seen, it's very funny, anyway, I'm not going to see it again, abandon it. The real events of this kind of Korean movies are very appealing to me, but I don't know why I can't watch them. This kind of film sums up a sentence: human nature this thing has never been human, are beasts, talk about human nature!
