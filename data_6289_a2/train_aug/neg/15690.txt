This film is about the concept. It doesn't play Daniel Wu. I'm certainly not interested in watching it. The film is full of scriptwriters' ideas, based on current hot social issues, urban schizophrenia, black heart factories, fake products and shooddy, etc., but it's a pity that I got a very limited theme after a long circle. I watched a farce. And I don't see the sense of joy. Less verbose procrastination, less disorganized, concentrated and precise expression and sublimation of the theme is what the director needs to learn.
