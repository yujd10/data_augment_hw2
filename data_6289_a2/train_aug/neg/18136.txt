Norton is beautiful. I thought Tim Ross was Dr. Ross, this look was really subversive, and he was so old and walking around. The villain finally wilted for no reason. The plot is simple enough to compare with gravity. Hulk is really Yao Ming, dare you look better. The spiritual connotation has been weakened a lot. Two women is much better than the one woman, screenwriter. If only you let the two women show up in the back. It shows once again that the humans have always been dragged by dirty teammates. The fight on campus is great from 2013 to 248.
