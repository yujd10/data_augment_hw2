I really regret going to see it, wasting time, wasting money, laughing, embarrassing, abusing feelings. I just want to ask where is rock'n'roll. Dapeng, do you have a misunderstanding about rock and roll? I played a whole movie on my mobile phone at the cinema for the first time. In comparison, I feel that "shyness", which is cold and without emotion, can be considered sincere.
