I can understand the flamboyant atmosphere deliberately created by the director, in which the inexplicable plot can be accepted, but the unattractive lines and performances as a bunch of people are really boring, and the play and the story are not only stupid, but the audience waited a long time and finally waited for the final battle, but the octopus was defeated in this way. One can say that the discontent of the whole film was lit by the public.
