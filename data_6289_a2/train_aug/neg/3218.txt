Success is like a television film, ups and downs and means of expression are very old-fashioned. Li Chen's personal aesthetics and artistic pursuit are not flattering. History is like a loose sand plate. The scenario is only to divide in hostile camps and let the plane face it. This is the ultimate goal of the film to show, but the budget is limited, the director lacks skills, and the feeling of substitution and enthusiasm are even worse than Wolf Warriors 2.
