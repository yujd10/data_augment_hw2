Children's movies. Every time you see that the bad guy is about to win, he doesn't kill the pretension, and then he's removed by the hero. In fact, I love the Green Lantern most, followed by Superman. Therefore, in the movie, Green Lantern Qiongyao is possessed, and Superman talks about soul chicken soup to the bad guy. The Green Lantern was almost forgotten in the back. The only good thing about it is that I got to know some bad guys.
