In my opinion, no character is established. What does the story have to do with 512? The name Chang must be "Feitian"? The script itself is weak. The last speech "aphorism" is even more. The filming said documentary by hand does not seem to show the truth and anxiety, but exposes the lack of the ability of the director to send to the spot. And where is the anxiety of the three hotheads who do not worry about money? If all this is anxious, then the whole world is anxious.
