The advantage is that it continues the style of this series, not to steal for money, but to encourage girls who dream of becoming big thieves ~ the characteristics of the actors are also taken care of, the neuroseism of Burton's wife. The stupid older sister of Hathaway or something (or perhaps their route is so narrow); the plot also arranges two turns and revenge, which does not seem boring. The disadvantage is also obvious, the whole crime process is very lame, who caught the fake necklace in the pool is not investigated? Why the ornaments stolen by hand so miraculously undiscovered after? Bullock and Blanchett's faces were boned and all the public depended on clothes.
