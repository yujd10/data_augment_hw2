Compared to Confucius many years ago, this film is more similar to the work of Hu Mei, a commercial director who transformed himself from the fifth generation. Although the film tells the historical history of Huipan's entrance to Beijing, with distinct cultural symbols, it is actually more similar to the films of revenge genre, and the historical context has become the shell of packaging stories and characters. Thus, in the film, each plot is in the conventional narrative law. However, animated by the smooth narrative, there are also extremely fragmented intrigue lines, the audiovisual grammar of the extremely chaotic director and the extremely unknown point of view. In previous works of this kind, the double representation of the life of the characters and the past have been separated by the author in the two male masters. In the limited space, the two cannot really complete the effective contradictory connection and emotional interaction.
