The lover who just disappeared yesterday, watching this film today, is also the adaptation of the novel. Why is there such a big difference? This should be the reason for the skill of the director. I also read the novel. The film was adapted quickly. The love line between Scudder and the prostitute was removed by the director, and the plot dragged on. To be honest, this film is really not beautiful.
