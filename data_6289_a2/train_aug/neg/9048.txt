Seeing the breakdown of the plot by Xu Jiao fans on Douban, I just want to say: what dog saw a scary plot of cruise ship type unfold? Please forget it. Don't insult the terrorist cruise ship, okay? It's not at all the same level, okay? Don't be so ashamed and lean on a good movie, okay? Xu Jiao was blackmailed and killed by your stupid fans, okay? It's a bad movie!
