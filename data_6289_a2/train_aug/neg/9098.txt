After watching the first two films of the very little Times last year, I said that no matter how bad Guo Jingming's film is, it's better than "living in Fuchun Mountain". Now I take it back... The photograph is good, the eggs are interesting. As for this sad and funny plot, it really shows the fantasy of dog blood that the girls of the college can write in erotic novels incisively and vividly. It must be popular in high school and below. Give 0 stars (I look forward to watching the very little Times 4 at the cinema while laughing and complaining loudly. Haha! )
