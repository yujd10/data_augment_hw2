To be honest, this film makes me feel the perfunctory fatigue and the exhaustion of Hollywood animation films. Especially in the stage writing, the creativity and imagination of the screenwriter have reached a state of extreme saturation or even boredom. The whole film has no ups and downs, the Hollywood editing line has a happy ending, the tears and jokes are perfunctory for the audience. The intuitive experience in the cinema is: "Hey, how is it that the boss died without anything and somehow forced a happy ending? There is no philosophical thought, but the Lego films of the same period are quite new. The mean weak chicken doesn't have the sense of existence, we can see that even if the propaganda efforts to create a dark atmosphere of stimulation and rebounds, he can't save the boredom and boredom that emerges from the film.
