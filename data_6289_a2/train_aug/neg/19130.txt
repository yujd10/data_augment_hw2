In the experience of watching movies on pins and needles, giving a low score does not mean that the film is not good, but it is wrong to make it boring. Russ is always sophisticated in narrative techniques and skills, the double-edged sword lies in the way so strongly shaping such an image, the degree of great scope of its influence and effect, it is absolutely not worth advertising, such specific darkness, it is completely offensive, disgusting, and the use of the first person, it is difficult to claim that it is not a positive film, from this point of view, the behaviour of the director is even anti-human. I just hope that he intends to create a subject by pulling it to the extreme. The film itself should be banned.
