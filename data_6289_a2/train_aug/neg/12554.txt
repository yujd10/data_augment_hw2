After watching this film, I have removed all the films of Yang Fan that I had never seen before. Old Gay's joy is almost a kind of self-deprecation, hypocritical and disgusting, and this disgusting film under the control of affectionate feelings. Feng Delun and Yin Ziwei are comedians. Can I stop pretending to be beautiful?
