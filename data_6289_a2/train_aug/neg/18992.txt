I can't play with the bipartite struggle between the government and the country. I thought it was a cult style when I saw the trailer. In addition to the various hasty appearances of the cleaners, there was only one conversation of conscience between the virgin. What a good frame, how bad the director had to be to make this film like that. The madness of the trailer makes me wait too long.
