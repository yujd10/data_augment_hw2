The director may want to say too much, but none of them is complete. It seems that the magic realistic films are really not my type. So far, the favorite film of this kind is "The Sun rises as usual". The performance of the little girl was excellent, the film was well received by the industry, and the little girl should be nominated for the best actress Oscar.
