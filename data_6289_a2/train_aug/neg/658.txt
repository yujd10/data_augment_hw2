Guan Hu's weak narrative ability is revealed in the murder, and he must always rely on constant flashbacks to make the story barely logical, but random flashbacks make his story a disaster in the structure of the narrative, but killing people because of the depth of the theme is barely able to carry the theme of the film, and his poor narrative skills make it boring. It is very difficult for the public to stay in the cinema for more than an hour.
