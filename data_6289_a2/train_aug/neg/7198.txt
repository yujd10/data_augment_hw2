And to the one I'm looking at: Leave now. You're so much better than that. Write a few sentences in 2018: I was still very proud of Ayer, who had nothing to do with the quality of the film, mainly because of his own posture and his own gains. His way of managing the negative things of the film, the failure of the film, the drama behind the scenes, is so sincere and mature acceptance, and has learned a lot from it, whether it's film crafts or to get along with studios/fans. I think it doesn't matter what the relationship with the Studio is later, in my opinion, this time he left with grace. The heroine of the white lotus in the universe died of the whole family, ha.
