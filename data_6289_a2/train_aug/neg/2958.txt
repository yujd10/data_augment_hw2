I watched it for forty minutes. The soundtrack of this film is extremely poor, and the dialogue between the children of Feng's first scene continues until the end of the stage, and the laughter of the actor who plays the young Yang Mi is also repeated twice; the image is extremely poor, the hard bonding work at the beginning is amateur, and the matte effect such as falling from a cliff is more inconsistent than that of the old TVB TV series; the performance is extremely poor, not to mention the protagonist, and the eyelids of the girl sleeping on Yang Mi's body continue to move. Xu an is too bad. Yang Mi has a pure face when she is a teenager.
