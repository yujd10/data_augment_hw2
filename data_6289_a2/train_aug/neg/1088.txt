The only thing to see is these girls. Bruce Lee is not only a crappy actor, but even more inclassical when Wu Zhi. As soon as he pulls his hand and lifts his legs, his opponent is out of his ass, and there is no confrontation at all, that is, the sets of dragons and BOSS are waiting to be beaten, the same routine as the domestic anti-Japanese dramas. No wonder the audience has such a degree of overlap.
