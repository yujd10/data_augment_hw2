Overall, I think I've seen this talent. But it doesn't look so good. Whether it's Sean's vision, the love between these two people or the love of a woman, it's clear that people who don't want to talk to others and don't have friends have a lot of understanding and can't agree with each other. Of course, I understand that it's a dream story that comes out of the day (probably), but it's very subtle.
