Distorting smuggling, selling feelings. Not only the director of the film, but also the crazy praises of the public in Douban. The plot is childish, the stalls are accumulating, and the actors are ugly. What feelings ah, besides seeing some games you played and movies that you saw, what else can you tell me? I even know what's in your mind: look! I've already played this game! I saw this movie! I know this rod! All the films of the great director have played these things. How good I am!
