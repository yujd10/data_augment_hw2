Two and a half stars, I hate Ben Stiller's performance in this movie. I thought his acting skills weren't good in the "home evil" before, but not so boring. I think he has great potential as a director. Maybe he's more suitable for him than an actor. In fact, the theme is pretty good, but the rhythm is not good, didn't tell a good story, the last part of the best part is not bad.
