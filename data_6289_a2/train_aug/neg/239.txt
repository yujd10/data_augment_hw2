It is not a remake but a sequel, which explains that 1 million of the beard buried in the film was accidentally encountered by others, but the plot of the whole play is very absurd. Although the beginning of each episode repeatedly emphasizes that it is a real event, which tm believes you? Not everyone is a normal person, and the small roles are numerous and have nothing to do with the theme, just to compensate for 10 episodes, as if they freed from black humor but boring from time to time!
