After watching # FIFF1# late in the night, I'm sure its material is complete, but this kind of love film is not to my liking, it's not that the film is not good enough, it's just a difference of taste. Young Winona is at the top of her beauty, and young Bell doesn't need to lose weight madly to show her professionalism. Young Dunst already has a certain aura of the future queen of Cannes film, and even Aunt Su San, "the crazy flower at the end", retains one or two points of young charm. Youth is really good. I admire youth.
