A story of ghosts invented by a blind chicken is mysterious, but in fact, the director himself does not understand what to say. After watching it for a long time, apart from the thrillers and all kinds of ghosts and zombies running out of the way, there is really nothing to see. Moreover, the actors are all good, and the children are big. It's a cry away from our family Park Tsan-woo. Moreover, it's called bait. Koko doesn't have a theme anyway.
