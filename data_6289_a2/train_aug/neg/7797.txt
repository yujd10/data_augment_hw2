I'm sorry to add Luc Besson's label. Crazy. I can't believe the 7.3 score is amazing. Dare not be less than 5.5 in the future. If it's not lower than me, I don't believe in Douban. The bad guys make people laugh to death. How does it make bugs and pretend to be a teaching film? heroin doesn't commit suicide at the end, how can it be worthy of the public! Fortunately, it cost a yuan to see it.
