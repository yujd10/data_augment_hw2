As a son of MiyazakiHayao, who first tried to supervise the work, I do not know why he operated on such a heavy original work. From the point of view of the original work, as long as he is unable to carry a large amount of information about the original animation material, it is the palace itself, and has spent a lot of energy to transform into their own style, the consequences are probably unimaginable, not to mention a newcomer. Ghibli worked very hard in terms of production, although the results cannot be recognized.
