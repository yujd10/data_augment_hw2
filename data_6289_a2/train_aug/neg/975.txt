I'm definitely a fan damaged by the Mingyue series brain in the Qin dynasty, and I'm from the level of the first hair or a handful of cakes. But yes, I'm going to play a star! First of all, these mentally handicapped fans, do you really want to become stupid yourself? Be a bit rational, okay? Can you score 7 points for that?! The plot gives me goose bumps. And Shaoyu, what do you mean? If you want to change your mind or something, look how quiet it is in the morning! Where can I put my magnolia?
