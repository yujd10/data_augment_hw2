The first minute is full of skiing, looking very confused. Photography to properly expose the image, the ski costumes of the actors are filled with led lights. I thought it was a ski show, but it didn't feel just 30 seconds later, like a metaphor. Who knew that the skier rowed for half an hour (it seemed like it would take longer), then suddenly broke the window and became an agent. It's a divine trick. After watching it for less than 20 minutes, I don't remember clearly the slot point. Fortunately, I made an appointment with the girl to touch her thigh. I don't know if she thought the film was too bad or was caused by me, so she took me home to sleep. Thank you for the wrong film.
