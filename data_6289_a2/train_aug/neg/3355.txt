I really didn't expect to waste more time than the TV version. The characters read lines to super-act, the lines must pretend that nothing happened with too much background, but it seems very clumsy and deliberate, the whole process of didactic sensation. Obviously break a lot of parameters but the rhythm is slow and lazy, at half the parameters cannot be explained, and this already ridiculous set fixed to the public seems even more stupid. The character relationship is paler and flattered than the TV version. The music has lost two stalls and has become meaningless and futile in an attempt to make suspense, except when the image showed an increase in the budget and when it was time to see blood, it was useless to finally see blood, and the progress of the image of light had a ghost use.
