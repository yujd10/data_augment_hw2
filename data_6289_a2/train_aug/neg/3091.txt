1. The problem between the director and the screenwriter is so great that no actor can save him. No style of director, no language of camera, the script limits the game of Liao Fan and Wanqian, the lines are written as a shameful execution, Gu Xiaobai is really a shame of the screenwriter. Two. It is not a crime film, it is a fantasy. 3. Li Yifeng's lines have improved, but it is a pity that the director did not give him "photogenic". 4. The first film is like this in ten years, so don't do the second.
