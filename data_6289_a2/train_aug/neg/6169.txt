When I finish three movies in two days over the weekend, the biggest feeling is that radio and television should not be blamed for bad horror movies. What can't be refined and can't have ghosts? Look at these nine stories, which you don't have ghosts, but who you're afraid of? Of course, every story takes place at night, and it has to be linked to three o'clock in the morning, so it's really not easy for the storyteller to do it, so it's another series that continues to come down, and it's estimated that there won't be any more 4. It's said that there's no connection between stories at all. In fact, there's no connection between stories at all. What's more, because of the short length, all sorts of bluffing ghosts appear too quickly, without suspense and unknown, and the sense of natural fear is very weak.
