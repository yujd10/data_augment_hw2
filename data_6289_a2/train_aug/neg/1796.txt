At the beginning of the film, the scene of people all over the street will save the girl is really big. There is no such big scene in such a famous gangster movie. Wu Mengda, as always, plays a small role, and it is very appropriate for this kind of role. Her absurd style is not to act. I should be the same type of character in real life. The disadvantage is also obvious, the script is too poor, the quality of a film should be based on the script. A star is given to the actors and zero to the film.
