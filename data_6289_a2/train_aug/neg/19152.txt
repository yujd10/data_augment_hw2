Whether it is good or not to watch a film does not reside in the theme (although the theme itself is not new), but in the convergence of the plot / scene. The connection of this film is loose, the love of the representation of the hero and the heroine is not in place, and the title La DÃ©couverte is not very thoughtful. It is only at the end of the film that the rhythm of the film returned to the track, and the shooting of the marine landscape at the beginning of the film was the only point to see.
