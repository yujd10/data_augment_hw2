It's a film without conspiracy, without fight, without special effects, without special effects. I don't understand why it's not enough to hire so many stars to paint the wall to destroy Deng Chao and them? The character's decor is also super bad, either wooden or stupid Chen Jiashang has filmed the four famous arrests. It's not a bit to fool the father.
