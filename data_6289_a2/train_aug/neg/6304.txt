Personally, I don't blame the local style of the film, even if it's a comedy, but the local style isn't equal to the turtle wind, okay, Zhang Yibai, that's swollen? In the past, I had a bit of affection for his personal style films, which were instantly destroyed and erased by the song and dance shows of the Home Return Troupe.
