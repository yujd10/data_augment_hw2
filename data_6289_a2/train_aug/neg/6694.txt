The friendship between the United States and Japan was established at the beginning, and it was a dream at first. Long hair seems much better ~ coming out of a magic film like the Ring ~ and the long dialogue of YUKIO, I jumped ~ Don't talk so much! Is it Wolverine's story and the Japanese girl? There is no favor at all. The YUKIO combat scene is much more beautiful, and the sword man is also much more beautiful. And why can't I connect with Wolverine 1 at all. Who is this dead John?
