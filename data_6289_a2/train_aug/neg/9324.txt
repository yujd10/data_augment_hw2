Douban is really tolerant of American science fiction films. This one has no value to watch except for special effects. The plot of the old Middle School II is not as good as the Chinese online novel, and the plot is so chaotic that people don't understand what it's going to say. Two words are always repeated in the head when you watch the film: far-fetched and unreasonable. Is it because I haven't read the comics? If so, please mark on the poster: those who haven't seen the original comic strip should not watch this film. Moreover, as a science fiction film, there are a lot of things that can't be explained by science and have no scientific reason, which are unbearable.
