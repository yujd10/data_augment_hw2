I can accept "Zombie Bride" because it is attractive, but after that I can only feel tired when I watch "Christmas Shock". No matter how good the music is, it can't save the simple boring and garricle song and the dance of the story. The style of painting doesn't suit me. I'm really not finished. I'm sorry. Another: it shouldn't be Halloween shock?
