To tell you the truth, the original cartoon and the animation are very good, the quality is super high, the style of the cartoon painting is fresh, and the animation has become a classic. Only this movie, I'm sorry, I tried very hard to see it two or three times, changed NTU, the frame is too far away, there is no charm and a bright place, except for Sora, there is no acceptable place. Moreover, Hanamoto and Sora are not the same road, not the good taste.
