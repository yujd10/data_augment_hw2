It was worse than Thailand, and there was almost no point of laugh. I felt like I finished watching the whole audience as if in silence. The plot is also scrambled, mechanically paved together. I didn't realize that the pink head was yellow until I rolled the subtitles. And the three times Zhang Ziyi came out is not as important as Fan Bingbing in Thailand. Ziyi, you have to beat Bingbing. I've always been optimistic about you!
