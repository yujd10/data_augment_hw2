Wtf, you have to save them, so civilians living outside should be eaten by dinosaurs that are exhausted for no reason? Regular and mediocre, and metaphors for China and Russia were boring and stiff, and when the tyrannical raptor started the auction, I thought it would be the Asian and Russian offer, and there was no surprise. Ps: the little girl can let Lily Collins play when she grows up. And my favorite plan of the whole film is the last moment of confrontation between the lion and the dinosaur.
