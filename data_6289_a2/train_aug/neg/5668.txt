Oh, I haven't seen such a stupid movie in a long time. The rhythm was so kuso that the hero hung up as soon as I came. I was confused. The general routine of the plasma film is that the masculine master lives to the end and sacrifices organ transplants for the female master, whether they match or not. The dirty hands occasionally catch him, and in the last half of the time they talk about the master woman fighting back. This criticism is also quite funny. The hostess was really sorry to know how the starting point of American beauty was.
