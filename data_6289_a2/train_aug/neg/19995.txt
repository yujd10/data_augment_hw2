The scenario is so bad that it blinds some former actors. The forehead is as light as water, there are no ups and downs of the plot, no exciting action, as if we were looking at a series of domestic policemen; at the end, from Doctor to Long Brother, there is no direct logic, just to play the employer image of Longgota, just like the lady of the service industry, the best for the most wonderful part (false the most wonderful part), really shameful!
