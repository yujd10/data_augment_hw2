Go see, too unhappy, like a father with a girl, can not watch directly. The film is either unhappy or ok. After reading it, I felt unhappy, but I didn't feel particularly shocked. As a film, it's very ordinary, but it's a very miserable film with a campus theme. It's not very recommended, and the women in it are not beautiful.
