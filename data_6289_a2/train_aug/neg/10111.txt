It's a shame that I watched a long film without watching a short film, and the director was chewing several jokes over and over again, as if, "Oh, I found a special idea called pause-time. I won an Oscar. Oh, I can't think of any other ideas at the moment. Let's play this joke again and again." If you cut the only good ideas in this movie, delete them and drag them together, ah, it turns out it's a short film.
