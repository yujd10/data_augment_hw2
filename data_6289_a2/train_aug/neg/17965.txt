# the story of youth written in the 1980s # and # looks like the story of youth written in the 1980s # there really is a big difference between the plot "in order to help sick students give decisively the money they finally won". I think post-80s and post-90s writers can't write it anyway. It's really the plot that appears only in "Don't cry at the age of 17" and "The season of flowers and rain".
