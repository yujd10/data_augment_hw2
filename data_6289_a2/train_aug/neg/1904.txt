It seems that I'm one of the few people who give an evaluation of a star, so I better tell you my reason. If you're friends who haven't seen the TV version, you'll feel very confused and unable to enter the room. For those of me who have seen the TV version, it's no longer a question of fried cold rice, but of fried sour rice.
