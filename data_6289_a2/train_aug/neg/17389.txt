Why can you see the tear glands that weep when you look at the limestone house? When it comes to BG, pure love is indifferent? Why does Mao have to conclude a plot so uncreative for such a beautiful image? When Mao saw the end, four words came to his heart--joy, smell, joy, and see. Seeing the beginning and knowing the end of the story is still my least favorite type. The intention of five centimeters per second must be: the last five minutes will be positive.
