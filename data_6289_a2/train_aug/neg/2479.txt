My friends all said that it was a bad film or that they were giving up their lives to accompany a gentleman to see it, and it was unexpectedly bad. The story is neither new nor sincere, and every story is boring, not to mention the tone of the latest promotional film of environmental protection. All the actors have fallen, and even Ge You, who can still support the scene, is so disappointing this time. PS. And why all the actors speak in such a tone that they miss Party An and Party B?
