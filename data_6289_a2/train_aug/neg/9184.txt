One thing Indian films have in common with Zhao Benshan's Xiao Shenyang is that they are very self-righteous in the essence of their minds. The first is Indian song and dance, while the second is Errenzhuan in the northeast. Their problem is that they can't understand that these things with the national quintessence or regional essence are actually a little bit of quintessence, and most of them are still in the process of hardening, for those of us who don't have the same sense of regional pride as they do.
