I don't understand why imdb is 7.7 and Douban is 8.7. I feel extremely depressed when I look at him. I don't see the lightness of Shawshank's redemption. I'm not desperate even when it's the most difficult moment in Shaw, but this film hides hope so secretly that I can't feel it without thinking about it.
