Maybe the ability for personal understanding is really not profound, the plot is procrastinate, east and west, I really can't chain up, vaguely feeling that it is a discussion of human nature, the hero is selfish and partial, suddenly there is a period of people and animals in the middle, a little don't know why, it's very depressing from beginning to end!
