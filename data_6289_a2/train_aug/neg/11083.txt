I understand that the director wants to play realistically, but the rhythm is too slow, the lack of the best parts and changes, the tension and cruelty of the war are basically not filmed, and several characters are powerless. Inexplicable resistance, inexplicable sacrifice. I almost fell asleep several times during the observation period. I do not understand why I was nominated for the Golden Globes.
