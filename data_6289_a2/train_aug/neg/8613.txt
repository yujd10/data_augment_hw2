If my mother hadn't been in many thrillers and horror movies, how could I find this movie to watch with her? There's nothing unexpected in the plot, the rhythm always slows down suddenly, and the protagonist can also get chickens caught. Finally, I couldn't hold it and fall asleep. Sleep healthy in the middle of the noise.
