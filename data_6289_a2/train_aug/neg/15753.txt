Although I scored the film I saw on May 5, 2014, I didn't want to find Chen Weiting today. My male god Chen Weiting?! Guest starred in a lesbian movie?! Oh, buy it! This degree of surprise is no less than the discovery of Sherlock in the story of the love of the lesbian drama Nancy. (bye-bye manually) there was no score at that time, this time adding a star to the male god!
