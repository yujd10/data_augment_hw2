It's really boring. The adaptation of the plot is a mass of confusion, and after looking at half of it, I want to leave, except that there are some pieces of Lao Chai music that don't seem to have much to do with the nutcracker. Sometimes I think I'm watching a bass version of Alice in Wonderland. I also think Kayla's grandiose and neurotic character is more interesting, the mouse is cute, and some scenes are well designed. Sister Mackenzie... It's even more Reiki and beautiful in the image.
