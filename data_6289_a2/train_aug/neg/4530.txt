Since we want to put the context of the war of resistance against Japan, should we talk about the political correctness? How can such a twisted story resist these fallen soldiers and innocent civilians? Who will comment on their human nature that was massacred by the Japanese invaders? If people like Ang Lee occupy the general public and invade consciousness, who will rise up and sacrifice for everyone next time the nation will be in danger? I fear they are not all ridiculed like those patriotic students mentally retarded in the film. The pain of China!
