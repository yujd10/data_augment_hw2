Disney's Bollywood-style film is like an American with a difference between his words and acts, saying that he is in the Middle East cosplay, but his body is in hiphop. The most important point is that it is clearly using the packaging of Arab culture to tell a politically correct black story around the corner. The composer and choreographer did not care (and perhaps does not want) to understand the long tradition of the fertile growing ground fed by the desert and the Mediterranean, playing rich exotic music. I missed the opportunity that cultural diversity could have reborn in a classic.
