I don't know if the writer's head was beaten by a donkey! When the police couldn't beat the gangs, they asked Batman for help; the gangs didn't do their "business" and found a clown to support them, and some Chinese came out inexplicably, which was disgusting! Watching this two-and-a-half-hour movie is a waste of time!
