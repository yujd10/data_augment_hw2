The purpose of watching this film is to kill time. The man is not pitiful. What has he lost in marriage? Someone works as a babysitter to wait for him, but as an artist, he finally accuses his wife of being too hard. In this case, I would like not to get married in the first place, chosen compromise, and blamed others, giant babies, cowards.
