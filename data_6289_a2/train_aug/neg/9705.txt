There is also comedy on the label. It is indeed a comedy. The protagonists are very cold when telling jokes. It is very funny to find the talents of actor smoking. The theme is rather stupid. Just find an animal and say that it is a cannibal. Such a big sheep bites the protagonist so muddy.. The protagonist also looks like a stupid child.. Dare to make some innards snack pictures of this piece of fucking CULT? Oh, that's stupid.
