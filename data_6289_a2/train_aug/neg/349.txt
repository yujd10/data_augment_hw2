To tell you the truth, I don't really believe it's Chen Guo's movie, even if it can't be a classic, but it's not so much below the standards. A star for Hao Lei, Pan Hong, music bar, baby do everything you have to do, please. And finally paying tribute to the dead star is several meanings, there is no access to the purpose of this film.
