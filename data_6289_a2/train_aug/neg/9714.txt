It's my most cheated Duban movie, because the high score chose it from among the four films, which wasted more than two hours of my precious hours, damn it! No matter what the director and screenwriter mean, I don't want to watch the movie like a riddle! David Lynch, what an idiot! Besides, these tens of thousands of people give this movie a 5 to prove that they're not idiots, or want to prove that they're idiots?
