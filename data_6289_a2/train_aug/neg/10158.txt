The script is the same as that of a child. Yang Jiadong, what have you checked as a policeman? Is the right is better than you? Where is the suspense? Where is the sense of time? The strange love dog blood Parkinson's, is not a mystery for a long time is not a "floating city riddle 2"? I'm sorry, I really can't see the scriptwriter's technique, and I can't feel the charm of narration, and much less the aesthetics of Lou Ye's film. After the screenwriter set up the frame of a genre, there is no real plot, big pieces of drama of state and emotional behavior and unprovoked character, and this feeling of fragmentation and fragmentation is certainly not caused by censorship. I really think that Lou Ye and Mei Feng should read the official story of Henggou from "the house hanging on the hospital slope" to see how others build an ethical tragedy that extends over decades.
