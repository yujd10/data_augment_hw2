Very formalistic, the aesthetic is so dull that you have to go through the suspense to get some excitement, right? I just want to say two more points. If you travel through a novel, I'm puzzled by this kind of cross-timeline. Why do you still have memories before you change your timeline after changing the past (everything has changed, but you haven't changed)? Or this kind of story often involves a very strange idea, that is, people, at least the protagonists, have a "soul" that transcends not only the body, but also the timeline. After making a behavior that changes the past, your spiritual attributes, like personality and memory, will not be affected by it. A kind of physical and mental dualism (although you can get the memory of the corresponding timeline by touching others in such a strange way) Moreover, the so-called butterfly effect is often oversimplified, simplifying the impact of small changes on the whole system.
