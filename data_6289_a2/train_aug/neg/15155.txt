I thought it would be better than burning when I won the prize, but it made me aware of patience, restraint, thought and insight under fire. Unlike this film, logic is not established, the characterization is superficial, the plot is piled only for the final dramatic tension, and there is no subtext for every action to taste and touch. I understand that it is a commercial film, but it is also possible that I take very slowly the initiative to see a good film with more effort, rather than a lazy film. But the interior design inside is still very beautiful. Especially the living room and the kitchen.
