If Lao Ta tests the upper limit of the film, von Tier sometimes tests the lower limit of the film. This can be reversed in the future. We cannot deny the height and depth of certain works by von Tier, but we must also admit that there are grotesque and distorted works, just as this film has existed for nearly 1/5 centuries, and many people still cannot love it.
