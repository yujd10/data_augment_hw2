I don't know why this movie is recommended at times, and I don't know why it has such a high score on Douban. When I saw it for 30 minutes, I thought I had the wrong movie of the same name. Moving to the second half and seeing the legendary Faye Wong and Tony Leung Chaowei are convinced that it is the movie. Except that Takeshi Kaneshiro is very beautiful, Faye Wong is beautiful, Liang Chaowei looks like my brother, and the shape of Lin Qingxia is very suitable for Fan Bingbing, there is nothing to say.
