There are too many irrelevant absurd jokes, slow inexplicable movement (especially in the shootout), negative IQ of all characters (except Zhong Hanliang), no suspense, slow conspiracy, and the actor's bad performance. In particular, the role of Zhao Wei, I hate the most role, a distinction none between good and evil, no ability, prediction, judgment, encountered setbacks on hysteria, was sold for the number of money, a complete idiot.
