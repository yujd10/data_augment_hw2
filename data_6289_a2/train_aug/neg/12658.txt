Big mouth beauty Julia Roberts Julia Roberts and beautiful guy Cliff Owen Clive Owen spy cooperation film, initially thought to be very beautiful, but by the plot of stupid procrastination so that I lost my appetite, or even did not finish watching directly deleted; the original beauty and handsome guy can not play the same no head, traces of design are too obvious to master the rhythm of the film, really can't watch, anyway, I don't like to watch, it's a beautiful boy damage ah. Fortunately, with the unique neuroticism of my favorite Paul Giamatti Paul Giamatti, it's okay.
