Children's film, production of assembly chains, more young teeth than the first story, and the scene shrinks, watching points fall, Jack Blake cameo and burying a prefiguration at the end, the first half of the atmosphere of puppet appearance is more excellent, the second half of the demon dance has begun to be boring and chaotic, but the set is still a standard holiday film, bluffing the children, like a fanciful thriller, no bloody scene Fierce combat is like passing through every house, and the demons are all the appearance of a paper tiger. In fact, it's a ferocious type of family reunion in his bones. From an adult point of view, it's still too scratching, not pleasant, and insentimental. ★★★
