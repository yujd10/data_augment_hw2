The year of the Rooster was repainted the New Year. I saw it six years ago, but I don't remember it. There's a long way to go, and there's no trace of wild geese. In recent years, they've done a lot of repetitive things, and they seem to have done nothing and stagnated there. Every time I summarize my feelings, I look like I'm growing up, but the next time I'm still going as I've already walked and made the mistakes I've made. Is the hard nature to change, or busy, the head is chaotic, can't find the result. In 2017, I hope to live in peace and clarity.
