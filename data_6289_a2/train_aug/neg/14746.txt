The voice of Batman and Joker in Batman Arkham's series is the same as that of Arkham's Knight. But this story is so scandalous that the bat wants the clown to cooperate with him? It is not consistent with Batman's constant subjective thought. Batman hates criminals because he is a criminal who kills his parents, but he never crosses that line. However, in this film, it is said to cooperate with criminals, which is totally contrary to the original character.
