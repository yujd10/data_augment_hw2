Even though cf is a lifelong fan of true love, I have to say that the choice of the script is not flattering. What is the director trying to say exactly? I don't know at all. I was fooled to see the end. Are you kidding? It took more than 90 minutes for the director to show his interest, his aesthetic vision and his taste as gay. He was very good to provoke the desire of gay, and even mock himself. In other words, he sold corruption with the plot.
