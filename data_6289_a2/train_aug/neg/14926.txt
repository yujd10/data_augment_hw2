Perhaps it would be more appropriate to show it in a play, where there is no interlocking reasoning, and the detective is more like a perspective that leads the public into the plot, but some omniscient perspectives are somewhat destroying proximity. The case is relatively simple, and what I want to express does not lie in that.
