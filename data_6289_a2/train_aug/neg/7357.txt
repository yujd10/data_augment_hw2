Thanks to Shandong Airlines, thank you for flight SC4884, thanks to the people who organized the program on this flight, managed to refresh the lower limit of the score of the film I saw in Douban (the last time was in 2014, it was a disaster at Heaven Palace [4.2]), let's talk about this film: 1, the plot: mediocre, watching one minute can guess the content of the next minute, isn't it cool to force the mother and child drama? 2. Villains: stupider than aliens throwing C4 explosive fleets in the "Super Battleship", throw dozens of missiles. Do you think you're launching Shenzhou X? 3. Sensational: even if the protagonists read the main theme lines, they even add a narrator to promote the main theme. I'm really speechless. Rhythm: these shooting scenes made me feel like I used to play live CS. 5.
