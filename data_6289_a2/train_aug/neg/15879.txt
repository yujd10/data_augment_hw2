...... I haven't finished it. A very interesting subject, but a very boring way to say it. Is it really the work of a qualified director? Rely too much on the language, it is a waste of the shape of the film. The script itself has a difficult wound. If the film wants to be academic, the stupidest way is to express it and simplify it in words, and it takes all that. All KK had to make was a sign that I was acting hysterical. Hard work, no talent.
