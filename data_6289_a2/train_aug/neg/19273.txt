"Escape of the Jedi", "Railway Flying Tiger" and "Kung Fu Yoga" on the first day of the lunar new year, Jackie Chan in 2016 is a bit prolific. This play really burns the heart of Jackie Chan, by the way, I want to build my son who has a bad action, and it is also a pity for the hearts of parents all over the world. The film is cut into paragraphs, and some of them have no effect on the progress of the plot, only for the pleasure of funny passages that seem silly.
