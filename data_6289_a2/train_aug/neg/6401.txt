I peed all the way, and I watched a broken taxi for more than 10 minutes at first. Tom Cruise, who plays the killer, pushes him all the way. The fighting scene was extremely dull. The camera's objective is very bad, boring and boring. The blockbuster was supposed to be a battle of mind between the killer and the protagonist in the chicken soup for the elderly soul. Oh. It's a shame that there are some big actors in it. Why did Douban get 7.4 points for this spam movie?!
