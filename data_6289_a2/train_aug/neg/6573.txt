Very boring poison soup. Put all the things that require hard work and skills to get in the play of a child, hanging up to the good luck, heroin is always a boring ugly girl that forces beauty. Everyone is stupid, the rhythm is slow, the goal is not beautiful, the performance is grandiose, the lines are embarrassing, and I do not understand the meaning of this kind of film.
