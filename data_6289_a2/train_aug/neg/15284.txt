I really don't understand why there are so many critics. There is nothing special about photos and special effects, but there is nothing special about stories and characters. Many people repeatedly emphasize the second story told by Pi. Indeed, we can feel the link between human nature, survival and other elements, but the little space plus intuitive narration, how can people have a deep reflection and aftertaste? although it has something to do with the previous adventure, the fantasy without the image is meaningless.
