Daniel Wu kissed Yao Chen as soon as he appeared on stage, and I couldn't help but say "tmd." I can't believe there's a "based on" in such a stupid movie. The dog's blood is without spirit, but fortunately there's the beauty and flesh of Ah Zu (> _ <) to see. No, no, no. It's a bit of a city atmosphere of sin, but everything else is wrong.
