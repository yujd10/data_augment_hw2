This is the first Hollywood film with complete Asian programming in recent years (the last was the Joy Luck Club The Joy Luck Club, 1993). The film is successful from a more Western background (Singapore) hoping to change the stereotype (not quite attractive) of Asians (especially Chinese). Although it is not caught in (a mistake often made by Chinese films) to show a life full of money, it is essentially guided by Western universal values, and subconsciously there are still environments that Asians "do not know how to refuse." In terms of the cultural heritage of the overseas Chinese, the traditions preserved in the early years have been different from current habits. It may also be a question of whether or not to identify with the film. (during the release of this film in the United States, there will be English pronunciation and Chinese subtitles.
