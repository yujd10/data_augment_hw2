It's a really bad film. I don't even know what it is. It's said it's a horror film, but it's not at all scared; it's said it's bloody, and it has nothing to see when it comes out of something similar to plasma. The whole film has no cerebral connection, the only thing is that there's a MM exposed two points, but the exhibition is not 5 seconds by the second bird. Ladies and gentlemen, even if you're bored and want to kill time, you won't introduce yourself to watching this layer of shit.
