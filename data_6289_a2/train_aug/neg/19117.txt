I still like some of Feng Xiaoning's films. At that time, I was very happy to see the first film with my hands in the air. But the second part, on the one hand, is that the joke is so childish that it takes the audience like an idiot. Moreover, making such a film is neither ironic humor nor black nor stupid words that occupied our Japanese army for eight years.
