I have a premonition that the global view of the world is really amazing. After reading, I found that only the beginning is OK. The rhythm is either too slow or too fast, and the turning point is too steep. I do not care to have a scene of love, but it became a pure love movie in the last step. I thought that the red was so strong, but I was even more confused as soon as the flame retardant boy who was domesticated in a dog came out. And feeling that the classification of risks is not quite right, the dangerous degree of green can be no less than the control of electricity and the cracking firebar, to know that the IQ to some extent is also very terrible. Obviously, it can become a good theme like the Hungry Games, accordingly.
