There are too many cracks, ah, the raid is not planned, there must be surveillance in the pit, ah, it's just giving people a head. If the man's knife doesn't leave him early, there won't be so much to do. This place will die. Why not talk so much? Start doing it directly, ah, and fight for nothing. It's better to destroy them with heavy weapons directly. They're all outlawed and don't want to eat after watching them.
