The film tells the story of two turkeys riding a machine to go back to the first Thanksgiving, trying to stop people from using turkeys for holiday dinners. This seemingly creative idea does not work well in the film. The implementation of the set "Save the Turkey Plan" is not as exciting as the "chicken run" style, and the dramatic part is not as hilarious as Grand Father Fox.
