When I saw the sea, I guessed the type of film, the title and the score of the film. I guessed that a movie was finished with a star. I dared to shoot it, but I didn't know how to shoot it. It wasn't as good as it was supposed to be. What I would like to see is the sophisticated and complicated reflection and internalization, which is lacking, but no effort has been made. However, from the point of view of "those who are beyond the reach of their work", it is still necessary to attack the direction of "those who don't live", and it is also a generational normality, but "capacity and capacity" must be based on their own commitment and ability and courage to bear the consequences, otherwise it is bullshit.
