It is obviously a very commercial story, but it is surprising that it can be filmed so well that the appearance of such a Chinese actor has been completely spoiled, even if it is transformed into a second version of the TV series, it will not be so bad. It is so insipid that people can produce no sense of substitution, there is no presumptuous anxiety, and the performance and drama are so bad that people are drowsy. The main theme of this kind is actually the dross of the time.
