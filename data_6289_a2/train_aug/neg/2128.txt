A star and a half, extremely disappointed. The monsters of special effects of Western style are in contradiction with the group calithenics of the construction of Zhang Yimou's large-scale spiritual civilization, as if he was preparing for the war while playing on stage, more like a monster who failed to combine China with the West. The framework of the five armed forces is a complete decoration, and I don't know what that means.
