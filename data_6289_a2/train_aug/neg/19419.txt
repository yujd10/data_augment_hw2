It's too far from what I thought, so it's just two stars. The rhythm of the film is a bit crazy. The whole article is full of hypocrisy, only impressed by two places, one is that two people speak in the mouth of others, and the other is Tang Wei's speech to his mother in his coffin. It looks like the director wasting two actors. PS: I don't support Bonzi speaking English. I obviously have to play with an American accent when my language is short. Can you come?
