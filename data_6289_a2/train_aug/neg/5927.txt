It's like watching a fake Star Wars movie, another series that takes too much step to create a Star Wars universe. The story prequel in this episode is as boring as it sounds, cobbled force together the time of a movie with an action game, forced all sorts of fake better elements, and the characters were pushed with anxiety by the plot, and finally directly transformed the action game into a noise in the ear. It's boring to extend an idea of strength in a film for the sake of the concept of the universe.
