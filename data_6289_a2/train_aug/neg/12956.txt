When I saw the news of the Federation of Arts, I felt that this piece had been abandoned. I also knew that the image was not good when I saw the opinion. But I didn't think it could break the lower limit. The Beijing article doesn't need the narrative of the dialogue, the whole process doesn't know the meaning of the QQ style pain narrative youth, the content is extremely empty. The last two articles are getting better and better, but they are still monotonous and extremely common. The dubbing is quite awkward. Cantonese is not what people say normally, regardless of the lines or tone.
