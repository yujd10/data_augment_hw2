Although it is based on real events, the rhythm of the film is not good and the characters are not well represented. The hero in the film acts recklessly and has no respect for the team. he makes decisions about everything by himself, but he is neither intelligent nor rigorous, whatever the consequences, regardless of the overall situation, whatever the overall situation, although the action is successful at the end, but much depends on luck, the accidental element is too great. At least that's what the film shows.
