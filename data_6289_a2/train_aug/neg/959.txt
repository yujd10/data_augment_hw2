Are you kidding? The united fleet was wiped out, Tokyo made a barbecue, and the people of the house could not eat. Take a group of child soldiers and let the opposite plane rub itself against the sea. Can the government still wash this kind of garbage? An army full of defeatist feelings, with body punishments in vogue. Dying and daring to die can change the fucking concept. That's just because it sank after a little soy sauce, and the ship was blown to the sky, the ancestor of the concept of weapons.
