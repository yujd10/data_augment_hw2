I didn't even want to admit that it was Spider-Man. It was the extension of Bug Iron. It was the following Tony Stark, the spider costume model, not Spider-Man / character, no character story, no history, Europe, not New York, Zandaya, not MJ, Tony Stark, not Uncle Ben / Peter Parker, Queen. The average high school student in the district is a good neighbour of New York citizens. He is Spider-Man gone.
