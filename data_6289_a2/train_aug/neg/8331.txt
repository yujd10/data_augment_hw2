The Hong Kong movies are so depressed? Lin Xue and Wu Zhenyu both came to the continent to cheat money without doubling. Bizarre Hong Kong Putonghua, but Lin Xue speaks the Henan dialect and Tianjin is very funny. The last scene I saw seemed to be the piece of land north of the third North Ring Road of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, a little surprise. 2012.08.11
