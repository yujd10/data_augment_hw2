I was asleep after watching her, and both were waiting for the end soon. The one in the back row is currently taking his son to see him, so numbly, are you sure that this film is suitable for 8-year-olds to watch, and what more, do you think it's really good for you to explain the plot to your son aloud in public? As for the film, there are no surprises, the plot is out of date, the special effects are ordinary, and 3D is even more deceptive. So, if there's no good film, you might as well go home and sleep together.
