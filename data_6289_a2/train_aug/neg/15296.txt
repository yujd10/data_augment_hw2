From my love for Bishop, I will no longer play a star. For example, One Art is obviously written to Alice Methfessel, although by the previous 14 projects (it seems to be this number) and the final project, it is not difficult to see Bishop's substitution of Lota's physical characteristics and personal experience in Brazil, but in the end, this poem is intended to retain Methfessel and succeed. Bishop's understanding can only stay on wikipedia, and he can't even read the whole wiki.
