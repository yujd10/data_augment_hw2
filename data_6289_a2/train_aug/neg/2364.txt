Why did I label it epic? Is it all because of the pronunciation of the shit? =! For the first time, I was quite skeptical about Douban's comments. This film is simply the level of a domestic blockbuster. Is it because I moved too fast to shoot a film that lasted three hours and a quarter of an hour in three hours when I felt it was a waste of time? Is it because I suddenly lost unlimited interest in ancient Greek mythology during the night? Is it?
