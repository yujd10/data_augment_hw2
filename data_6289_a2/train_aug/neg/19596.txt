This Spanish cartoon is really crappy. It is not up to the average Hollywood standard. I don't know if the title of the film is called the Dragon Rider on purpose. In fact, it has nothing to do with the dragon trainer at all. Inspirational is not deep. There is something wrong with the style of painting of the hero. The discussion of the law is not in depth. There is no room for fun. A little impatient of production.
