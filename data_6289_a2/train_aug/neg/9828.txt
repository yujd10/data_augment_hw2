Quentin was hacked into the worst moment. The plot and structure are a combination of the old defenceless and vulgar novel, the objective has hardly changed, and the only stretch is the subjective scene after the entrance of the hotel server. The film is not only the background of ppt and flash, the director has touched the background line of my understanding of the film, deliberately skipping the action with editing and close-ups is a chicken ah? The front lens is too stiff.
