There seems to be everything, but it seems there's nothing. In the narrative film, it must not be Lao Li's best job. Ah, by the way, there's this complaint, which is interesting just to see, but it's a bit weird when it connects to the whole story. I really don't see how a drug dealer going to jail can complain about bin Laden who has nothing to do with him. I can only say that the Americans are patriots.
