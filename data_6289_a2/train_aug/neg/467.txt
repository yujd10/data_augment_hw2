I found a fact: with a score, Douban won't let me write an essay. Blood Dizi did a good job in public relations. I had to change five points, write a essay, then change a point. In fact, I just want to say: this film had to be directed by someone else in Yin Liu Weiqiang. From the point of view of Infernal Affairs, even though Liu Weiqiang doesn't have a brain at all and speaks in his sleep, it's better than "Blood Dizi".
