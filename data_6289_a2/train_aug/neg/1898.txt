This area must be blackened in a star. There are almost all the characteristics of bad movies. For example, when you run for your life, you suddenly stop expressing your feelings for a while and then run. For example, when the plot is tense, I suddenly stop to remind my childhood. For example, in the face of a great enemy, the protagonist fought about unequal mating. For example, when a bad woman sees a witch, she takes the Holy Grail to kill her teammates. For example, the City of Skeletals is a flash in the pot and the Holy Grail has not been used. For example, the bad guys can never be killed, and the reinforcements of the good ones are always destroyed.
