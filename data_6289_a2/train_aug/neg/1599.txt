1, the protagonist looks like Kenichi Matsuyama 2. Hypnosis is false (hypnosis is not professional and the hypnotized person won't be so excited when she wakes up) 3. The film doesn't know what that means, and even seems ridiculous to me, and there are contradictions in some places. 4, not a good story 5.
