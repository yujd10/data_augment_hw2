I knew it was a bad movie but I went to the movies because I was bored. There was only a general impression of the plot. I remember very clearly that Jason Stanson was beautiful in a baseball cap. I loved you even if you were a boring movie critic-I didn't have feelings for Lan Lan. Is it true that Grandpa Stallone can't go home for his old age?
