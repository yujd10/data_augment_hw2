It's a really bad movie. Before watching it, it was said that a girl would be chased by the killer, then run and fall. And then there's some! It's a big laugh. I died too early and complained too much. The lady friend fell in love with the killer as soon as she was killed. But what about the feeling of superiority after watching the super bad movie?!
