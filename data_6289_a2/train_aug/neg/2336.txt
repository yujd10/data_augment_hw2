Originally, I was looking at the three male stars, but it turned out that Wang Baoqiang himself was a pig's foot, and neither the male nor the female were so good, but the performances of Dapeng, Xiao Shenyang and Yin Zheng were quite correct, but the three combined stars were not for them. A star was for the last monster. It's not easy for China to make such a monster. It's worth renting. It's better to write more articles of this monster. It can be a guy. We haven't reached the active technology yet.
