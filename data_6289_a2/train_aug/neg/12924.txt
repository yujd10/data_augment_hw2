To tell the truth, after watching so many horror films, the gap between domestic films is still very large, the objective and the editing are very amateur, and I will not talk about fake accessories. In general, they are sincere but not attentive enough. Given the national conditions, continental horror films are really difficult to play, and a high quality film "Green Nightmare" has been produced over the years.
