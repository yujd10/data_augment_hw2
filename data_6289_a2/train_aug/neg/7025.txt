Why can't Douban get a negative score? Why can't you get a negative score? # Don't tell me anything. Don't think it was shot by Wong Kar-wai. It's good, even if the director is Deng Chao, it's a bad movie! Don't tell me if you don't think Tony Leung and Takeshi Kaneshiro are spoiled, fart! He also spoiled Eason Chan, Jia Ling and Ma Su. Bad on a word, too many to write! #
