The rhythm is really slow. It takes a lot of time to bet randomly. It's not at all fun. The game is nothing new, a frame so interesting, unexpectedly didn't play well. The action drama has become a very stupid cosplay, and the eschatological sense is also perfunctory. My Sanchi family is really random to pick up the work. It seems to be a wb producer, so Americans still don't come to Japan? Special effects and art are not bad, but the lighting is not good. The image is very dark.
