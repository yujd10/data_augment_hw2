Barely two points. I slept once. I don't understand why Ridley wanted to make such a film for his brother after Tony's death. There's a big problem with Exodus's story. God is a brother of the underground world here. He doesn't pay attention to principles and depends on his mood. When he thought of the boys who fished Egypt, he brutally killed the Egyptians, flouted and disgusting, and even the underground world of Hong Kong wanted the boss to talk about morality and rules. If you can't properly manage the image of God, it will be impossible to tell this story logically. Compared to the caricatureal avant-garde Prince of Egypt, this film is lethargic, all supporting roles are functional characters, and Moses is a unicellular creature (the most reasonable and rarest the last temptation of Christ).
