I can't even give two stars to my goddess movie. Korean drama films, the authoritarian president falls in love with your plot, an embarrassing soundtrack, plus the inevitable scenes of rich girls catching love, inheriting family business, jumping buildings out of love, etc. How empty a person can make such a film, using the theme of the last century.
