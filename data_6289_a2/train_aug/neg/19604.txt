After reading some descriptions of the original work, the adaptation is really very misleading. How ironic it is to ask a man to adapt a woman's work or feminist work! After watching the film, I have to sigh: raising a girl is really about being rich and expanding your horizons, so not to be sold by a small favor. Why is this story so suited to our situation in China? Ah, it seems that there is no escape from this strange circle of education anywhere.
