I do not like it subjectively. Compared to other films by MiyazakiHayao, although it also conveys the protection of the environment and seeks a balance, but the plot, the relationship of character is chaotic, especially in the second half, the arrangement is inexplicable and tiring to watch. The protagonist is also very desirable thought.
