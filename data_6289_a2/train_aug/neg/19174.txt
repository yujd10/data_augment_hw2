The expectations are too high. I'm still disappointed. As a ghost film, the special effects are OK, but the degree of horror is too low, and the ghost in the film doesn't make much decision, so he's directly amazed by his wife, slightly disappointed. Finally, I realized that it was a romantic film dressed in a ghost film. It's a shame that the ghosts of Guojiayuan and Guo Caiyi are too insipid and don't have many bright spots and strong points. No, the camera of the scholar at the end of the film is Xi Xi.
