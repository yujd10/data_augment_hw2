I didn't see it. It's obvious to read the profile. Turkey, a patriarchal society, is a way for men to wash their own interests. People who fuck don't deserve to have love. And from their psychological point of view, they can't love a person for a long time. If a woman has a lot of sex and ends up looking for an honest man, you men can already have cursed. The existence of this kind of film is the acquiescence of values such as men can have sex with each other. Dedious.
