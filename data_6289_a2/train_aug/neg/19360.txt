A film that is not pleasant to the eye, Oda cut the decorating film. The whole film was very embarrassing, and all the girls said that they were definitely in the top three of the most embarrassing movies they've ever seen. I like the two minutes where the male and female couple wanted/know what was going on and then went to test the other one to see who took the first step. The atmosphere was so realistic!
