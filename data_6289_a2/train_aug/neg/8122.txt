A real movie is a real spicy chicken. Have I watched a science fiction film? A lot of things that don't make sense from start to finish are totally anti-human? This China? Crime? Build a gun? Kill a cop for fifty thousand dollars? Heh! What's more, the acting talents get in place from the beginning. It makes me want to vomit and find someone to make a good comment? What do you say is so beautiful? Wow, I'm so angry. What's the end?
