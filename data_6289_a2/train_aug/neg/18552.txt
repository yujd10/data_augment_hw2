Is it a comparison between a religious village and a Buddhist temple, whether it is a fence built for yourself or a scene? guards and believers see that they are trying to avoid facial expression / direct expression of this feeling of superiority / that the conflict in the film is not caused by two religious sects, but a confrontation between a believer and the supreme political power / I don't know if it is acting or something else, although it has been restricted. Sometimes it still tends to silence rather than silence.
