The director obviously does not understand Chinese culture and confuses the Chinese funeral with Italy in a wrong way. In fact, adding the protagonist to the incarnation of justice is only because he is a carefree loser in the Vietnam War, always trying to regain the so-called American glory. As for discrimination, there may be, but personal bias is more appropriate. Zun's facial expression is not as introverted as the Chinese, pretending to be elegant, and his body is too thin to support the head table.
