I don't know why, even after more than a decade, I still can't watch it again. The first is that I can't agree with the price of love in the film, and history doesn't let me see that the three people really love each other. The love and tragic end of Gu Cheng I can understand, this film doesn't let people see the emotional entanglement between the three. Does not have credibility. And even more hate the so-called sexual freedom and openness in France. There is no sex of love, like animals. The reason that human beings are human beings is that they should be called human only if they have feelings.
