The faces of this person's fans and production team, for example, I went to the university entrance exam and took all the subjects in the heat of June. Wen Zong 120, maths and Chinese 50 each, English 30, the total score was 250, although it's bullshit, I really tried my best, so I didn't do anything wrong.
