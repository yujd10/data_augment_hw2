In addition to the 3.2 note of "The Great Cause of the Foundation of the Party", which was not shown in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations, I finally found another 3-realized film on Douban. Yes, the director of this film is innovative and goes to worship to pay tribute to "two great smokers", but the end is nothing more than excellent and extremely bad. Unfortunately, this film has moved to a very bad extreme, with a crappy dubbing and an inexplicable character design.
