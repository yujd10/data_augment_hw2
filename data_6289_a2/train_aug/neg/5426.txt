There is no sense of substitution at all. I don't know what the director is trying to say. Killing the Germans doesn't feel good at all. On the contrary, it reminds me of the scene in which the Japanese soldiers only want to assassinate the infantry of the national army with armoured vehicles. What a hero to kill a prisoner, no feeling. The Germans are faceless, inhuman, bloodless and unreal. One point, let's go.
