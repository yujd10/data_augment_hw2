A group of exquisite wild animal puppets pass from house to house, unable to cross the valley of terror, and have lost their ancient integrity. Frankly, King Lion is a replica of the dialogue of the TV series Shaweng. At that time, the best part of the cartoon was a great opening and romantic charm, but now it is as realistic as the National Geographic Channel down. CG is powerful and useless, and its mouthword is good.
