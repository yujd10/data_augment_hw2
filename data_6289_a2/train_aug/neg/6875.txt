I made a mistake when I wanted to see the version of the film. The first episode was a little interesting, and then it was very procrastinate and abandoned. The whole show feels out of control and out of line. The ongoing plot of the American TV series probably gave up completely, impatient, each one I saw is very procrastinating, some of the plots are OK, and most of the plots are six and seven.
