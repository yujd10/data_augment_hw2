At that time, when Cai Jun's novel was published, I almost bought it, but I finally missed it because of various factors. Now it seems to be a great blessing. Such a thick book has been working on such a hypocritical story for a long time. Cai Jun himself is also a group of unreliable people. In the end, he made an unreliable film, the script was not good, the editing was confused, all kinds of vulgar scenes made me sick in the stomach, and the actors behaved as well and badly. After reading it, I am very confident in my work!
