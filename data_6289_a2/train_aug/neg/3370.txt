It is totally the hallucination of the losing middle-aged men. The concept is good, but the story is too bad. The black and white tone was treated too early to expose the director's intention, without any icing on the cake. Jiang Wu's character is a completely useless fool in any world. He does not understand the meaning of such a parallel space and how difficult it is to make a choice. The lines are poor, and the joke of forced entry is even more frightening.
