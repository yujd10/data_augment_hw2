I always thought the actress was Miyazaki Kui, but he turned out to be rich and beautiful, and his performance was barely qualified. Compared to Hasegawa's role, Hiroji Hasegawa seems to be too weak, and the overall thickness of the plot is not enough. It is a common mistake of Japanese films in recent years.
