In recent years, the performance of Korean characters is too facial, people at the bottom are always nice, the bosses of small and medium-sized enterprises are always nice, while the images of bureaucrats and large families of business consortia are ugly and dirty. live horror, veterans, initiates, kings, etc., all are like this, can you really make such a simple distinction? Each film should also set up a basic hero who is desperately fighting for people at the bottom, which is too deliberate and sensational. At the end of the film, the United States will be blackened by the fact, as if the IMF had provided assistance, but has not been appreciated by the parties.
