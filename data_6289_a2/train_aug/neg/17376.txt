The first half is quite OK, hold it, laugh all the way after the fight, move, roll around the city, is there King Bahobali, the plot is reversed, your sister is so shallow that you can guess every step, I was wondering if you dare be creative, but you didn't. And pay homage to Akira Kurosawa? What's the resemblance? Look at the warrior of the shadow again later. It.
