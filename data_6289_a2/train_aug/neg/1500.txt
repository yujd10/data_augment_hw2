Really stupid JB, Tim Burton, I thought I couldn't appreciate his pseudo-gothic style stupid animation, later through this and the previous comparison, I really understand, to believe in me, this film is stinking and long, but also chicken playing through, the muddy and meaningless film, the previous version of the planet monkeys that just can't be put together Whether it's the atmosphere created by the setting of the plot, especially the end, it is very inexplicable.
