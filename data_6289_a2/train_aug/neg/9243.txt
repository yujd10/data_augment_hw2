What I mean is that the whole film is full of too much violence. From the beginning of the appearance of the big polar bear, it makes people feel very scared, adults, not to mention children, cousins say it's terrible. Compared to the bears that haunt the Spring Festival before, the tone of the whole film is darker. Regret it!
