Lin Jiaxin is invincible. Is this film really a comedy? It's not funny at all. Deng Chao's two jokes (marriage is a grave, swearing) are too old-fashioned. A person inside spoke with an accent, which made him sick to death. Is it true that Lin Jiaxin "essentially I eat trees (vegetarian)" orz and Yi were shot by the same person? Huang Xiaoming is very good to be beautiful. It was a fine thunder.
