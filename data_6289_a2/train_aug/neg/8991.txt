After watching the first two episodes, I have my own problem. I really don't like the fact that people from Great Britain, the United States, France, the United States, Japan and Russia all speak Chinese in the room, which is not available in historical conditions at that time. At least be serious. How about a little professionalism like "kite"? They're all made in China, and the delay is not long.
