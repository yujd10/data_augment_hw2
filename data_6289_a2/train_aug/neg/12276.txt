To have all the common flaws of domestic-themed films, we should not only show the bravery of our army and love the people as a son, but also show the contradictions within the national army, but also show the magnificent image of a great man. In a word, the length of the film is too full. Nearly two hours of film length cannot accommodate such a quantity of information, and the story is very heroic, but we cannot see from the film that the war scenes are bombarded without discrimination, and there are documentary planes.
