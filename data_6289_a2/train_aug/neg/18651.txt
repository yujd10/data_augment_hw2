I haven't felt Jane Eyre's story since I read the book, and subsequent changes in film and television works can't change this situation, nor this new version of Gothic Xiaoqing. Maybe it's because I don't like the bitter and bitter background of history, or what kind of Witty Dialogue and Ironic Tone suits me.
