She's still in great shape, but Demi Moore is really old. Although there's my star goddess Widow Sister, the plot is much more boring than expected, the jokes are not funny, the story is pretty mediocre, not to mention the hangover, even the humiliating trip with Elizabeth Banks is much more interesting.
