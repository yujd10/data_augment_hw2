Two stars, I played games, although I understand that due to the problem of time and space, I can't expect too much. The main strange things are: (1) the real night is not cute at all; (2) the funny scenes specially created when the reasoning is false are not funny at all; (3) Yu Jian's claustrophobia is gone (but there is also a reasonable part of this change).
