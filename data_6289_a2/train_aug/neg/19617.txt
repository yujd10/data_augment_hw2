I came to watch with admiration. As for me, I cannot understand it, but I attribute it to a divine translation. Most key places do not have subtitles and dare not watch movie reviews, feeling that they will only spoil the original understanding of the image. On the other hand, I think that "the adapted scenario" better absorbs the benefits of the film, and the film technology can also help to obtain a strong expression of personality and stylized narration.
