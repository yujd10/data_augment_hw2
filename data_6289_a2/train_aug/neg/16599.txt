The film has a lot of problems in some key patterns and rhythms, and the cause of the story is too deliberate and stupid, and subsequent turns are incomparably steep. The director can be in pursuit of the realistic style of action film of the old school to make the film boring most of the time, running all night the sense of urgency is not well reflected, really lacks excitement and the best part of the paragraph. 5/10
