Because... I hate all kinds of "reinventing words", so. From films to translators, on the contrary, I become completely a nuisance. From the point of view of my "serious and rigorous" personal understanding, it's really too "vulgar", "bad taste" and "bad taste." If the Japanese want to use this kind of tease to raise the average finger to the national conditions of Japan, the spectators, I suppose, are all Yamano villagers who don't have television at home. Second, it's killing people.
