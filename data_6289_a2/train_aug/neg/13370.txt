To be honest, I didn't burn because I didn't understand it at all. The Indonesian film is still not good, the story is too weak, the character relationship has not been established at all, the whole film is the same as the bipolar disorder, the fury is really violent, when it comes to the drama, it drags and cries, and the plot after getting out of prison is not sharp at all. The sequels of many films have a vision of the world too wide. The original thematic film is the same as Avatar, and the loss outweighs the gain.
