If he hadn't been for Tsai Ming-Liang, I wouldn't have gone to see the film at all, and after watching it, I wasn't sure if the plot of the film was consistent with what I thought. Procrastination and congestion are the criticism of this film, the play that can be completed in a minute lasts 10 minutes, and the performance of the actors can't accurately reflect their inner activities. Of course, there are many ways to express desire, which can be procrastinate and intense, and the making of a film depends entirely on the style of the director.
