This script really doesn't work. I find that even the three East Asian countries can't make sick films. They are obviously a nation of emotional constraint, but they can't handle it well. This film is even more problematic. Even if the video is completely broken and then combined with random, the director treats it as a concentrated show without dignity as a movie. Premature ejaculation is the funniest thing about teenagers.
