The logic of the first half of the drama is confused, and the second half of the naval battle is also bullshit. The scene is not as good as that of the Caribbean six years ago, which essentially belongs to the Smecta version of unarmed demons. In history, the naval battle of Mingliang is not at all worthy to be mentioned. Now it is entirely national propaganda. At that time, the sea and land were won by the Ming dynasty. Su Yuan's affection for South Korean films was completely ruined by this film.
