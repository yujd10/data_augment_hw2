There are Zhengtai, Lori, Royal Sister, and (no) uncles. There is science fiction, there are comics, and (many) blood and great scenes. Cass is not strong, the plot is not great. But why the film is so long and boring! The amazing edition of time and space is poor, and the special effects are medium. It seems very thunderous. I was confused when I had not read the comics. I must say that the cinematization of comics failed. If the three films follow this road, it would be a tragedy.
