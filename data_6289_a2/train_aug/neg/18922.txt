Like the TV version of SpongeBob, optimistic, nice, charming and friendly SPONGE BOB. The version of the film was turned off halfway. The plot is too boring to look good. It doesn't seem good. You better watch the obedient TV version. Especially the first episodes of the first season were very good. Interesting and creative.
