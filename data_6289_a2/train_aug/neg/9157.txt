The plot is so mysterious that I can't stand this kind of psychic film. When I become a ghost, I can do whatever I want as a human being. Many people say the end is good, but the end is absurd. The family of the original hostess turned into ghosts and thought they were ghosts and became human beings, so they couldn't accept this kind of plot. There is also a lot of religious dialogue in it, and the film is procrastinating.
