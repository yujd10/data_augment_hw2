What kind of shit. Below the evaluation, lower the evaluation, and in the end it's just shit. After looking at one or two, I feel that the man is mentally retarded, and there is no reason for his inexplicable sacrifice that the first. Do you still have to save the cat in times of crisis? Is it to show the goodness of the man's heart? How old are you? Or do you want to pull the cat powder? As soon as the bridge came out, I guess the stupid shit mixer would come back and cut the bridge.
