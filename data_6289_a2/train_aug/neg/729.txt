This kind of script really can't afford to hurt. Although it's different from the first theatrical version, this work is already a smooth painting style with a high silver fever, but this plot is too boring and illogical, don't ask for something particularly wonderful, write the story carefully, not so many flaws, the audience is not satisfied. Kubo cartoons are also gradually declining in the later period, and the crew and producers won't think so much to make money, anyway, they won't be able to make money until they can't make money.
