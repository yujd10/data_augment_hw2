This film is 8.6? At the beginning of the first episode of solving the riddle of the blackboard, I was disappointed by the play. Not all agents are professional online, GCD agents meet atrociously, the panic accident is an insult to our hero. After Cheng Zhener was hit, she was so spared that she did not copy the telegram. Isn't it bad for these hard wounds? Didn't you see a good film? Compared to the robbery and camouflage, the writer, the director and the actor are far behind!
