Ideal is really good, the decor of the collapse of the metro is really good, until all the escapes were electrocuted, it was wonderful and tense. However, the director, screenwriter and some actors were really stupid to the extreme. In the disaster, the protagonist and his party were slowly chatting about their daily lives, did not rush to escape, and had a great fight with their misleading rivals, plus some stupid talking companions, the plot was not at all reasonable, plus all kinds of divine music, it was really a waste of this good idea.
