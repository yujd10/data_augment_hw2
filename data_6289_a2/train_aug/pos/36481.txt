The story is incredible! It's like putting a cult story B in a particularly exquisite package, but after feeling it, I feel it's not only inconsistent but also cool. The roles of the uncle and nephew and their various interactions are really expensive. Finally, I would like to praise Ma Xiaomi, who is beautiful and dangerous is really the best approval of this role. I don't think Ke Shu Fa Shark Fu Lanlan is more suitable for this role than he is! Praise while wiping the sword of the nose
