In general, this film has obvious shortcomings, but the theme and creativity are still good, there are also a lot of jokes and some parodys that are hilarious, mysterious lunar bases, huge UFOs, counter-attacks on the earth, etc. The heroine Julia Diezer is so beautiful. It's amazing that a low-budget film can be made like this!
