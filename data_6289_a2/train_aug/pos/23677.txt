I think that when this kind of actor is a director, Liu Yunlong is pretty good, much better than some. Domestic movies still have to have a plot to support, dizziness and noisy is also better than no content, just the spelling of details to meet a non-talent director is disgusting. It's just a little too slow. For those who are sentimental and slow in vain, they might as well be replaced by the real material of Fan Mei's goal. I don't know how long his peak will last. The end is as good, Zhao orphan, people who have read books.
