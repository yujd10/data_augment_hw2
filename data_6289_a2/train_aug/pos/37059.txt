The exquisite and wise dramatic structure, the black humour incarnated everywhere, the bitter and sarcastic reflection, everything reflects the talent and spirit of Woody Allen, a tragedy full of laughter without shame, laughter in the community, indifferent spectators because the misfortune of the characters is out of reach and filled with happy air, comedy, that is, "time + tragedy", the greatest pain in the world is clearly wanting to write a tragedy.
