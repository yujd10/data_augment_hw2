A film from 2000. I seem to have seen it before, but I don't remember the plot. I watched it again today. At that time, Tony Leung, Zheng Yijian, Kelly Chen and Cecilia Cheung were beautiful and beautiful, and they all seemed very pleasant to the eye. The film is a magical existence, like a time machine that makes people look young.
