I look forward to taking it and watching it before the rest, and the church scene has been associated with the missionary. With several climax scenes (the car race starts, fireworks ends), the film tells this story smoothly and remains visible all the time. British amorous feelings, cult elements and the use of technology are all a little interesting. Balls are so cute. This is the first time I think someone dresses Fred Perry so well! (Eye star)
