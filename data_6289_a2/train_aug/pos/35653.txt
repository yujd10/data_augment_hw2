It's an online movie, and it can't be too demanding. Of course, it can't be compared with the previous movie Huang Feihong, but there are also some interesting points. Feelings are the reason most people are watching. Personally, I want to see the old version of Zhao Wenzhuo, Huang Feihong. I didn't expect much before and I'm not disappointed now.
