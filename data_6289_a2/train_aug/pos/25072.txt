Come on, let me think about how much I still remember-Uncle Takeshi Kitano had a poorly nourished film, but the landscape in nature was so beautiful that he was intoxicating. Van Sant's hero entered the screen and kissed the heroine. I don't know how to shoot it. Forget whose "porn movie", wow ha ha, is really a fantastic drama. Besides, a man hammered the new rich old man next to him with a hammer in the cinema. The blood splashed everywhere, the people around him were amazed, and then he continued to watch the movie. And Zhang Yimou's is actually pretty good. Several subtitles of Wong Kar-wai are better than the movies. Hou Xiaoxian filmed a scene at the door of the cinema, which was very insipid and very similar to an old memory with a little dust. Chen Kaige took it. I completely forgot.
