Use extremely stylized visual effects to deal with a familiar Westerner (fog?), which avoids the result of falling into the classicism of text to the image. I feel that the lines are completely copied from Shakespeare. If there is no subtitle, I really don't know what I'm talking about. The French shark is not as good as Ma Liang. Macbeth should have died of mist in the end.
