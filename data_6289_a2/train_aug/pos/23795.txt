I haven't seen so many Hong Kong movies in a long time. It's a crucial story, but it's not a 29-year-old story. I don't hate the dramatic way of the presentation. Many people want Huang Tianle's character to live Lin Ruojun's life. In fact, most of the time our lives aren't going well because Huang Tianle's appearance has Lin Ruojun's character.
