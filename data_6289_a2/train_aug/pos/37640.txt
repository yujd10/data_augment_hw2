When I wake up, I keep watching. Always defying the boring movie, always failing. Some think Wendes is making a mystery, and only those who understand his strong feelings of evil in the country understand the long plan of his expression. All five points. A film that is so beautiful from the music to the camera. On the other hand, Yankees are a bunch of vulgar guys. PS track,Nick Cave is really suitable for here.
