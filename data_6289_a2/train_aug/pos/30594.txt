I was so excited at first! 11 Great man, cute and cute, there is no difference in height between -- and Nai! It's so beautiful for the head of the village to play the villain! Star Eye [retweet] sota and Kyu Tanaka are also the cherry on the cake! When you see the long hair Kuriyama Qianming, you always think of PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS at that time! Cute and warm! I'm so happy!
