Surprise of the year! Gonzalez's cinematic magic is enough to enchant any audience. Some people have to remember "you can be someone", while others have to face "you're not important" squarely. The film can be analyzed from many angles, such as the drama, the legacy of the Hollywood blockbuster, the spiritual level, etc. Birdman fantasy, theft, virtual and real combination of the scene is like an animated film, especially like "Huiyuji". Photography and performance complement each other, and the soundtrack takes you into the room from the beginning.
