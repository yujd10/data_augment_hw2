Four stars; Xavier Dolan made another masterpiece after "I killed my mother" in 2009. Obviously, he fell in love with slow motion this time, and the image and soundtrack had the flavor of "in the mood of love". In the film, he played in an enemy play with heroin, but the plot was relatively weak and lost compared to the previous film. This genius Brokeback is very cute!
