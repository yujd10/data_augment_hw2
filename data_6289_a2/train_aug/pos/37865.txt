I only saw this film twice, once I saw it more than a decade ago, and then I couldn't bear to see it again. I wasn't in MOMA before last week. The film is no longer only about love, but also about the redemption of human nature, on how to get rid of history after the fall of the wall. There is a lot of humor, but more sadness. There are two details that I love very much. One is Gorbachev's thought, and the other is the passage of time and space in the exhibition of decadent Nazi painting.
