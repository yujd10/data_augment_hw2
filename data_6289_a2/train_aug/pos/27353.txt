A film of infiltrated crime that makes brotherly love more enjoyable than love, full of love beyond the affairs of the children ~ Zhang Jiahui is really excellent in action, with every frown and smile clearly surpassing the other actors. Koo Tianle has received a large number of films recently and has gradually drawn closer to the bad guys, but his roles of good and evil cannot die. As long as he plays infiltrated, he always sacrifices at the end, is it the special treatment of the actor? Gu Zai still needs to work hard. It seems that this.
