Tony is the only son of an overseas Chinese millionaire. Tony loves the white girl and goes to talk to her, and both reconnect. Jane knew that some girls were in prostitution at the boarding school, and she wanted to find a rich man to try her, so she took the initiative to talk to Tony. After landing, both went to Saigon, ate Chinese food in a restaurant together, and Tony brought her back to school. Just after school the next day, the black car was waiting at the school door.
