Bong Junhao is a real geek. At first, I thought it was a satirical comedy under the coat of horror, but I couldn't laugh with a smile. Forced in a desperate situation, the lonely hero rode alone for thousands of miles to save his parents, broke several difficulties, and finally caught the Han River monster and threw him fiercely. A sip of phlegm. And threw on his shoes. The fate of the small potatoes in the great background is both tragic and sarcastic. He held his turbid breath for too long until the hero threw the monster and spit him out.
