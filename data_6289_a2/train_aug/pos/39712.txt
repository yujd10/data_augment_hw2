I admire three kinds of scriptwriters: being able to tell comedy stories to make you laugh at tears, stories of suspense to make you nervous, and stories of love to make you excited. The scene in the pool was so beautiful that several supporting actors were very bright, the awkward and charming secretary, the brother of the big brother's bosom, and the heroine's sister of the beautiful thing. The heroine's smile is really cured!
