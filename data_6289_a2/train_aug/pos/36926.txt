The art of nature is the best art! The whole film is almost accompanied by music. The poor and enterprising youth, helping his little animals, strict and nice order. Accompany yourself, stick to your dreams, and feel the music in your life. The plot warms the heart. The wonderful union of small animals has reached all this! My heart has been moved by the persistence and calm of the hero! PS: I can't believe I'm so late to watch a niche animation film, but I feel very satisfied!
