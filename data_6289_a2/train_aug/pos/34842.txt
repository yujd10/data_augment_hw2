This year's continental film is the best and most surprising hope of making films of Chinese genre. Come on. Ps: Recently, I worked as a trainee at the Public Prosecutor's Office. Although the subject of Luo Shengmen is very common. But in the end, the sublimation of paternal love is very good, and it also speaks of the popular crime of the rich second generation. It's a very good scenario. Continue renting a bad director. Ps: Those who comment on something as long as it's Aaron Kwok's bad film, can you stop being so stupid? You have the evaluation of the film.
