The technique of expression and the colorful eggs of other jumping works are quite surprising, and some small original details can also reflect the intentions of the film director. Although there are regrets and slightly idealized places, I can still rent this film without hesitation as a positive manual to compress and cut the plot of the film. In any case, is it not also the purpose of "friendship, hard work and victory"?
