The solo dance on the grass is probably the most beautiful beauty of individual emotion in collective memory and the rotation of times. It became "abnormal" at the beginning of the long-term repression (it is really a psychological vacuum to return to the art troupe after watching the battle of flesh and blood) (the memories of the youth director embellish all kinds of scenes, which is a cover of the story). Who dares to take a picture and show it to so many people?
