At first, the conversation between the two policemen was very topical, "but when Mr. Yamada was really lost, he was even more frightening." Although it was violent, it was probably because it was too neat, and it didn't disgust me. Instead, I paid more attention to the heat under violence. The end will certainly think of "the quiet sea of that summer." Scene, music and music are all very similar.
