The plot seems to be very simple, everything contains a deep meaning on request, missed inadvertently these details. The landscape is super beautiful and the film is very comfortable! You can look at it again. There is an article presenting the historical context on Douban, which can be helped. Park Shu's "Jupiter" is very well written, in the trailer.
