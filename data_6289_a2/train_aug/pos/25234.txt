The 78lap100 series "Moonlight panic", which highlights the subjective perspective with whistling in the silent environment and the horrific murder, can indeed fit for the style "Silent place" and "Do not breathe" that lowers the hearing, so we see the wonderful long scene of the middle Michael entering the room from the street to the window and the sweating palms at the end of more than 20 minutes. Women become the heart of the confrontation, men and the police are brainless, and this new feminist frame is in line with the old version. The dialectical relationship between the patient and the doctor, the hunter and the hunter is advanced in this book, which is a new idea, so we can also see a subjective perspective of the hunter, still with a wasteful one. The soundtrack basically follows the old classical soundtrack of the carpenter, and adds many charming electric variations.
