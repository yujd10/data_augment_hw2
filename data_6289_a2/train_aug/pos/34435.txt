The huge gap between reality and ideal is unbearable, where there is no hope, there is no need to wait or compromise. If there is really no possibility of understanding between people, why not draw a circle as a prison? And no exile? Maybe it's just because there will be animation in the film, and the animation will do what these dolls want, let the brushes roll by themselves, and make the big carp and the broadcaster share the same interests.
