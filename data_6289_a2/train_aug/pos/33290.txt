Does the room move the space, or does the space move the room? Or is it the short box where the audience moves? By the transition of space and space, forcing the audience to open their eyelids, the audience can see that the room is made and decomposed, and the characters are created and dismembered. The audience was trapped in a malicious swamp disguised as a fairy tale, like a big bad wolf disguised as a grandmother. Such a violent film.
