There is ZOE in this world, they/they suffer in silence, they are thin and sensitive, and they do not know how to talk to someone when they are injured. They may have the shadow of childhood, or they may be injured by friends, or their families may be unhappy. It's just a lack of sense of security. They are alone and need a lot of love. Until I meet Mr. Tree, and then I was healed.
