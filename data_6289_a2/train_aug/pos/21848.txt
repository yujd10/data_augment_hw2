I think the quick money and the scarlet witch will be able to destroy the Avengers. It's a pity that the quick money is dead. Or you will see the next. In fact, the biggest bug has always been Thor. No matter how it is made on earth, it should be solved by the scratching of God. With colored eggs and a big boss, it becomes increasingly like the series of men x. But I love them all. Let's keep doing it!
