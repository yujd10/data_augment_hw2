Carla is a dog, the second is a dog, in other words, Carla = second, Carla is only the spiritual bearer of the second, a food. When Beijing brought her dog from home to Didu, many people asked me that when you had time to raise her, I just smiled and said, "When I go out to be the grandson of others every day, I also want to feel like a man when I come home." Actually, think about it this way, Carla is a dog, the second is a dog, and I'm a dog, too!
