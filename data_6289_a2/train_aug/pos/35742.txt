Perhaps I have more empathy for this one, but I don't think there is any assignment. My son bursts in tears twice (crushing in the wall and crying in prison), and I couldn't stop crying. Even Jeremy played by Ang Lee's eldest son feels real! This kind of feelings of father, father and son, family members, really touching, powerless and sad. There is also a bold and clear description of the political victims in the special era. Lang Xiong's performance is also impeccable.
