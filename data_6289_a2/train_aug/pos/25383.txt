You have taught me to understand that the tenderness of others is the power to transcend everything. I have let you understand that being strong and courageous is the strength to face the future. I haven't seen you for so long, you're always so sweet, but I didn't expect you to be so strong. Since you can courageously send me back without regret, then I don't look back and go forward without words is to respond to your tender and better respect.
