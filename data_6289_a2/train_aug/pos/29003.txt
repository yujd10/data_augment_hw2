It's a little nauseous. The film seems to take a knife and cut off the woman's past little by little, and finally really. Even though she grew up and has a lover with a prosperous life and a career, I still feel sorry for her and cry for her from the bottom of my heart. The last question was not enough, but she finally had the courage to face the truth and the wound she had suffered, and finally I wanted to hold them together, and everything would be fine.
