It was brushed twice, for some reason, I forgot to score it the first time, and I had no impression on the plot. I felt more and more familiar with it when I started to watch. Anthony, Geoffrey and Colin are all so beautiful, three generations of beautiful guys from the old, middle-aged and young are playing on the same stage. Ah, especially Father Hopkins, the actor is so good! I just watched "Silent Lamb" yesterday, and I plan to watch "Hannibal" tomorrow. I feel there is no discord between "psychic Detective" and these two films, like a series.
