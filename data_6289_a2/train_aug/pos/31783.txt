Wang Fei was sitting in the subway when she went home last night. I saw that she had an empty seat next to her and sat right away. She was wearing a small white sweater with a high neck, short braids and thin cheekbones. She always said she didn't want to take a picture. She waved her hand but smiled shyly. I knew she wouldn't pull or ask, and then I woke up.
