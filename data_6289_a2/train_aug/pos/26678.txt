The barriers between parents and children are inseparable, eloquent, gentle but powerful. It is Ang Lee's film, although one can still see the childishness of the technique, but the tone of moving and shocking the audience in a slow rhythm has been established. Older people will shed tears when they see this film. Moreover, the final result is indeed unexpected, but perhaps life is always unexpected.
