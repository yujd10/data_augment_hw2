I have always thought that Ang Lee is one of the few Chinese directors who really make films for the good of art. I am ashamed to say that even though I have always said that I love Ang Lee very much, it is indeed the first film I have seen. I am very grateful that the director can abandon the huge interests of the box office on the continent while insisting on the expression of the sexual scene. There is really no better way to express the progressive change of feelings between Mr. Yi and Wang Jiazhi. In addition, I love Tony Leung more.
