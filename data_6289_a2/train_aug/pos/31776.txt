Because of Dongmu, selfishness added a point. I prefer the end of the film to the feeling of the whole story, shooting scenes full of green grass from the prison's outer wall. I don't even want to stay on Tata too much to show this period of life. People can have a glimpse of his past and his unique state of mind, leaving this small part of the white to digest, review and accept. Maybe every time you think and proudly "live in the present", you can not help but have growing regrets at the same time.
