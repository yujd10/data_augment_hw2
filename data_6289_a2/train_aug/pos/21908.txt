The ironic name of TRUEMAN, his world is a completely fake and manipulated world. I like the last part when he hammered the wall. And I hate the first half of the movie a lot. I've already made it clear that it's Reality Show, but it looks too much like a movie. There are too many unreasonable photos. The film began to become interesting after Kirstow's appearance.
