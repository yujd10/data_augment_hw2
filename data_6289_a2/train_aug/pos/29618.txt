I really complained about Yu Baimei and Deng Chao all kinds of bad reviews on the first day of the release, and I was going to see how bad it was today. I was going to see how bad it was at first, the character was very rich, the graphics were great, the photography and the camera was so good, and it was good to see that the development of the middle plot was very attractive, and I was really moved at the end. It was obviously a sincere job. Why was it so devalued? It just breaks the heart of a person who really wants to make a good film. Where is tolerance?
