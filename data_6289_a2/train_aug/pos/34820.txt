I watched the TV version a long time ago, so I especially searched this period of history. I watched the same film during the National Day this year. I chose this one to watch with my parents. Of course, the overall level was good, shocking, positive energy, and the beginning of the image was a little unstable. I looked a little dizzy, and then I felt a little bad at the end, and the final scene was not shocking enough. The two chased boats did not present the results.
