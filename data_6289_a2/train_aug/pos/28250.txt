Truffaut shows the collision between people's efforts and pursuit and reality in his own way. He has shed in his own feelings and experiences, telling us that he loves films more than life. The film is so clever that it not only shows us the filming process, but also shows us the plot of the film. Including the various team conflicts and the rules that are still "in use" to date. People who like to make films must see this film.
