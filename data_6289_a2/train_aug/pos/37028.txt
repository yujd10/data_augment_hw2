I vaguely remember the individual conspiracies in the film when I was a child, but I didn't know my grandmother's name at that time. I have the honour to watch it today. In the 1987 film, the wonderful suspense was set up as the basis for the suspense films of the secret room from now on. But it was imitated and never exceeded.
