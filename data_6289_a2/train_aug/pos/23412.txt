It is so beautiful and charming that no one can compare himself to Keith in terms of the emotional appeal of sound and painting. The revolutionary use of music, each time suddenly sounded and then the black screen perfectly reproduces the feeling of "heart pump". Nothing in the past indulges in the final hymn of love, it is not a passionate percussion, not a low piano, but a sad and melody flute.
