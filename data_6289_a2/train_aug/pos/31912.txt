The theory of cause and fatalistic effect, if we had known all the reincarnation from beginning to end, would we have chosen to start this life without hesitation? The soundtrack is very sad, the end is open, these three weeks have been three science fiction films, on choice, the role of aa is probably the wisest Notre Dame. When it comes to linguistic assumptions in the film, I probably listened to fake professional courses at that time, based entirely on guess. There are a lot of movie subtitles bug.
