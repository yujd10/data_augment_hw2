Science fiction is only flesh and blood, and it is essentially a history of difficulties in Mexico. As long as the social structure remains the same, people at the bottom will have to pay for the future world of science fiction and utopia. This American dream and the world police are all neglected by capital operators standing at the top. From another point of view, this film is also a science fiction show, apart from visual enjoyment and philosophical thought.
