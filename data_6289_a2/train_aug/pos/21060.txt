I thought Alicia was an active role. Who knows. Decided by the beauty again ~ the return of the engine brought the authentic Jason, especially on the screen to see the flashbacks of the previous three seasons, like the tension of renting DVDs at noon in high school and watching the first three movies with my friends. After the Snowden era spy movies can no longer satisfy the audience with high technology, that's why I love this series more than Mission impossible.
