Revisit the film for the fourth time in six years, this time in a small apartment in New York, with more psychological shocks than ever. Maybe it's a deeper taste of life. From where you can see the impact of fantasy and reality, the struggle between reason and emotion, the impotence of the real world, and mixed with the desirable and innumerable beauty. The simplest and most complex and deepest film, no wonder I didn't hesitate to play five stars last time.
