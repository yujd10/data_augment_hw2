I am a mentally handicapped fan of Zhang Yimou. I have to watch his films no matter what. Many directors do not dare to set foot in this subject. "Living" was banned 20 years ago. There are too many scruples, which limit the performance of Zhang Yimou. I personally think that the themes of this time need "pain" to touch everyone's heart.
