Xuanzang was cursed because he saved his master's daughter in the fire and lived with a mask. Xuanzang lifted the curse for him when he met him. When he met a storm at sea, Galawa desperately went into the water to get writings and statues of Buddha. In the process, God himself removed his mask, so that his beautiful face could be seen again.
