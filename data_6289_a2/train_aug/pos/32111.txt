1. "two generations of Godfathers" in Godfather 2 acted against each other here. Looking at it, I couldn't help but think of the opposite piece between Liu Dehua and Liu Qingyun in "Dark War". 2. Hollywood's mature film industry is shown in this film through the dramatic structure of detached opponents, the warmth of police and gangster films, and the appropriate rendering of the atmosphere of music rhythm. 3. Similar to "Secret War", it is not difficult to guess its sad ending.
