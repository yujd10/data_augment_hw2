The legendary film that subverts the three values is actually straight - the story of two men and a woman traveling with three people can be found on sets all over the world these years, and it's Spain, and everything is normal. A very powerful film tells a cool story with a few scenes and colors. Although it's a completely different theme, what I think is that "the butterflies are free" that I came into contact with in high school. I don't know what the public thinks.
