I don't understand. There are always people on the Internet who say it's Western style and make them think they know everything. I don't think there's anything foreign in your family. Shut up if you don't want to see it. It's for entertainment. At least the film also learns the western style of art design. Compared to Pleasant Goat, don't you think that "Magic Brush Ma Liang" is very high-end? What kind of consciousness film!
