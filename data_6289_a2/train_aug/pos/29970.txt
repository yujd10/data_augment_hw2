The representation of the perspective of heroin is much clearer, but it still does not understand why it should be filmed in two parts. It is a very common story. As for the different angles, men and women think differently, this...... You can't let me watch a film with a microscope, and I can't say why. The pain of women for the loss of a child is explicit, while men are introverted and reserved, but both are so painful that they can't lead a normal life, but it is clear that the impact on women is greater. In "him" I think that the distress of man comes entirely from marriage, while the neurotic and unjustified woman described in "she" who strives to break up and indulge in the old is really real. The hostess hates why her husband can minimize the loss of a child, and can't get out of the strange circle, while men can't communicate and relieve this state of mind, so marriage exists only in name.
