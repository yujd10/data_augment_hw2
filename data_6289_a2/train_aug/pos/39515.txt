This film is in great contrast to the return, which loses the pure nature of the first and seems so false and affected. The performances of several elderly people are the stability and thickness of the film. Especially the old Zhaodi, as wife and mother, is so real. Thoughtless and sorrowful for her husband, worry for his son. Parents are worried when their children travel thousands of kilometers. On the other hand, the role of Zheng Hao is much distorted, because it is just a good image of memory, focusing on all the good thoughts. The young Zhaodi, played by Zhang Ziyi, has such a good look in his eyes, as well as the posture of running several times and the braided hair that jumps when she runs. The last scene has the texture of an oil painting. Run, followed the shadow of her husband. It is the most favorite film I have ever seen by director Zhang Yimou. It is a simple and real emotion.
