I did not see the play, but I feel that the film is still a good description of the chaos of the song and the dancer Shinjuku. The most impressive part is the role where Gang escaped into the street with a photo of Li Xiang. They already have the courage to want to die, and what can they not face? Like an interspered between the two factions, Brother Gang has a nice heart. When I think of Infernal Affairs, I want to be a good person.
