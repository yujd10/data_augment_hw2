I had seen Jude Law's movie several times ago, and I thought it was a disadvantage to look too good, so people couldn't focus on action, but I thought he could just act like a vagabond, a guy, and be a vase. Over the last two years, my hair is getting less and less, my face isn't there, and I always play a prodigal son, but it makes me feel impressed.
