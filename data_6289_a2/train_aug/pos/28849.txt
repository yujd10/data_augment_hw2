Jackie Chan is not a director, but a martial arts director at most. As the revolution was noble and tragic at first! Uncle is great, Sun Wen is great! Jackie Chan has behaved very well, but with the killer, Huang Xing really turned into a dragon in a second. Fortunately, it was less than a minute. Yuan Shikai is also very good, Chen Chong is also very good (often found that Xiao S looks a bit like lost Chen Chong), Hu GE is also very good, all supporting roles are good, Li Bingbing forgets it.
