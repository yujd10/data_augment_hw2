A film on a film. Sometimes, a film is not to promote certain ideas or to awaken a certain resonance, it is just a film. It meets the needs of all cinemaphiles: curiosity, paranoia, fantasy, virtual, and laugh, anger, and trembling. It is a film that belongs to Quentin, nothing else, no genres, no tricks (we can only say that Quentin used the techniques he wanted to use).
