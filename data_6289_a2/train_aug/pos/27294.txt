In a word, it is the manifesto of neoliberal human optimists: no matter how technology, home, emotion and human nature develops are even higher than the technologies that rely on data analysis and will eventually prevail. (The only ultimate goal of these technologies is to eliminate stranded and retrograde individuals or races and to create a perfect utopia that is accurate and effective. The ultimate enemy of human nature is still fascism in the mantle of technology rather than any other. What if there is another enemy?

What is more, this victory or defeat is also with the greatest respect for human nature since the Renaissance, as if it could continue to be invincible in the unknown world of the future.
