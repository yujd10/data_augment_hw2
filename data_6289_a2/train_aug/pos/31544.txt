It's probably because of this film that I abandoned the person I loved at the time, even though she loved me, watching a boring summer vacation in Shanghai in 2008. Always doesn't want to use occasion because she was forced by someone or something to make her remember and remember and most of the films will return to their first love at the end of the film.
