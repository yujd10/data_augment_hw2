I was really beautiful when I was happy to fight the monsters. There are a lot of funny points and touching places, like the doctor's spaceship, happy to lose his superpower, happy to save carefully, the head of the ball, the director of the television and Jia Luo led the masses to protect the stars and planets, which is very touching. I can say that I cried half at the end. Is this the passage after the end of the film the prefiguration of the next film? That's what the cinema staff said. Anyway, supporting Kaibao, Kaibao will always be the best.
