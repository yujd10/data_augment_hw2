I don't know what nerve this play has touched these so-called hard fans. Anyway, the second half has been reversed several times, and all kinds of anti-tricks are very pleasant. On the basis of the tragedy and heroism of chivalry flight, it has taken another step towards the realistic level: less secondary two, more flesh and blood, the bloodshed revolution, the difficult choice to abandon the car to protect the commander, and the impotence of the defeated soldiers. Even speculators like Benicio have seen their skills.
