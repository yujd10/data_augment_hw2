The pure word has been mentioned for the third time recently, but this time it is a compliment. This film is so pure that it can even become a model for all domestic films for young people, correctly establishing conflicts and resolving them, although these points of conflict are more or less blunt in this film. but supplemented by the pure blood and dreams that should be in the youth film, just dilute these defects.
