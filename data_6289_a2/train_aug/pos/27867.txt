It took three nights to watch the film for almost three hours. I don't know, I don't like the end very much. This ambiguous ending is not necessarily a kind of regret, but it will feel a little disgusted. Will the heroine and the youth of the coffee let nature take its course in the future? She should know very well that the person in front of her is another soul even if her appearance has not changed. What she loves is the man who fascinates her in the coffee. Or the man who later makes her crazy with passion. If she loves the latter, how can she accept others easily? Compared to the love in her, Bill has moved me. Whether it is man, father, or even president, each aspect is admirable.
