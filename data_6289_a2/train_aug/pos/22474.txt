In Red Flag Street and T-shirt Ma, Aojiao Girl, three single men and women watched together, hehe. I like it. It's very good that there's no suspense or bad ending. The sequence of the brother frog crushed to death gives the image of the body. Very good. When Gao Yuanyuan said on the top of the building that she would go down to see her grandmother and mother, my first reaction was that she wanted to jump and kill herself, then saw her grandmother and her mother dead.
