I have been very excited since I saw it. The special effects are really great! The plot is also full of laughs and tears, the front part of the cinema is full of laughs, the last part of everyone follows the king and the saint monk, the national teacher and the choice of the god of the river of great love and little love and silence, the sense of substitution is very strong! It's really great! You won't regret it after reading it,
