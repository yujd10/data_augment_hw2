In a story of intertwined black humour, each character of the film captures only part of the truth, and only the audience can see them shoot in the labyrinth of blood. For the first film independent of the Cohen brothers, which is a very inexpensive independent film, the excellent narrative ability shown is as good as that of an experienced director, and he has a good understanding of the control of the rhythm and atmosphere shaping the entire film.
