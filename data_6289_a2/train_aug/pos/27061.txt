My parents have money, but I don't have any money. Having an intimate contact, getting along for a long time, coupled with the matchmaking of friends and family, everywhere is love, will slowly get used to the other; women in over-grieving, often lack of sweet love, family, love, can be influenced. It's a very relaxed romantic comedy, and there are many small stems flirting between men and women. It's really great for my mother and my grandmother to pull the quasi-daughter-in-beast to see the striptease man, and the ending is handled slightly incorrectly.
