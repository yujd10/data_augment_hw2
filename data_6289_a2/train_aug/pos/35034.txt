The whole play is good, and the plot is very attractive. At the end of the play, Tang Shanhai, Li Xiaonan and Chen Shen are all painful, especially Chen Shen. I may eat that person a lot, and Li Yifeng's interpretation is very good. So when I saw all his film and television works, including the powerful animal world, I also felt that Chen Shen was the best character. After all, my grandmother shouted Chen Shen when she saw him on television.
