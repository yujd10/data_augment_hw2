Powerless heroes like Jesus in Gethsemane, his disciples left him when he needed support, which gives this Western classic a universal feeling. Textbook script time setting model. The characters are classic Western characters, Gary Cooper, the Van Cleef of "triology in dollars"! Rawhide's third man... Then the female master is the female version of Clint Eastwood--Grace Kelly in my heart.
