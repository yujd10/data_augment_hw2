The bags in front of me were so big that I couldn't guess what the story was going to tell. As soon as I started filling the hole in the middle, I threw a bigger burden (xx appeared). I thought the film was shocking, so I could guess the end. The end was a little hasty, and the blue army line was not well managed, without the carnival sense of several lines crossing like Quentin. Looking at the special effects of 2003, domestic films are not a little late. Come on!
