Last week, I went to the film shown by the English teacher. I remember that I had to go to a school to two degrees after watching it. I was resolutely afraid to go to Vienna for fear that Mr. Bei would hit my model. The film is correct, but the rendering of music and Beethoven's character himself is not enough, it is not enough to move, there are too many empty speeches about the soul, and there is a struggle about how Mark's design has no soul. Why is there such a professional discrimination?
