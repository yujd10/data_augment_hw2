I loved this film very much. I was so happy when I saw the parody or tribute of these 42 short films to classic films. I would like to have a collage to spend my youth with the lens. The hostess is also a charming person, and the actress is really beautiful. The whole story is not bloody or sensational, but it is touching, especially the last part in the room. Finally, when I saw the little world in these books, my heart melted.
