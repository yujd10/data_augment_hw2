Alicia's performance is delicate and touching. The film is elegant in tone and soothing in narrative style, just like a dirge dedicated to the young life lost, simple and without adoration, but every note hits the heart, which makes people hurt. Tears swirl all the time during the film. Touched by the separation of life and death in the film, I think of my uncle, my parents and the future.
