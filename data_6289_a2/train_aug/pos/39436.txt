The dirty sewer recalls dreams and subconsciousness, and the siren process being swallowed up by pustules and insects seems to show the despair of the man when the man's wife is tortured by a tumor. Finally, a close-up of the body (the head of a woman without pustules and a human fetus) brings the situation back to reality. I think it's a good film.
