4.5 Snow and ice sing, not losing their sound; white blizzard, still wrapped and sobbing. When the sky whispers to the earth, everything is so wonderful. About the mysterious life, about the sweet universe. You were born in the Noumenon in sincere communication. Do not wear beautiful clothes, do not apply Fandai, welcome a new journey. You look at the burning logs, in this quiet time.
