One of the best 18-year-old war movies. Only 84 minutes ago on the continent? Chrysanthemum. The end is breathtaking, and there is a tacit understanding between the two great powers. I appreciate them very much. This kind of war film is rare, especially the integration of submarines and land rescue war.
