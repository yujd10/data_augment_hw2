If you make a bad translation of a foreign language film, you have no character. The translation of the lines is not fair, the part of the sign language does not even have subtitles, it is still an abbreviated version, after looking at the cloud in the fog. After reading the full version, it can be counted as a first aid. But in any case, the image and tone are pretty good.
