I went to see a movie because I liked the original work. In general, it's pretty good. Apart from the use of mobile phone surveillance, I really don't understand why this paragraph should be added. It's really embarrassing that two women, two men and one woman face each other. I really can't understand the camera hole in the telescope and some surveillance in the phone.
