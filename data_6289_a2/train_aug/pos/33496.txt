Even if it's such a simple plot, it's really touching to be able to shoot so well in Disney's hands, and it's always nice not to be disappointed. Wolf and bear are so cute. The special effects of the whole animal are invincible. I actually feel a little tired when I imagine the little boy who supports the whole movie alone. PS, it turns out that the elephants are divine Boss.
