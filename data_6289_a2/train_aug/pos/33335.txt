Many people do not like the "cheating" of the girl when she returns to Ireland, but it is the climax of the film. Faced with temptation, we will become something to hide, this apparently incorrect value, in fact, is the freedom of nature, like knowing that it is a mistake, but also making a mistake. The turn was the question on the second floor, and the girl woke up, which reminded her of her lover in a foreign country and a freer Brooklyn. (LOOK of the time in the drama too)
