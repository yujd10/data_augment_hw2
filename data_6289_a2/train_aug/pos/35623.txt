The story of "I waited for you" is so long and beautiful that there is no complaint at all. No matter who weeps with joy at the end. Shakespeare's plays and the perception of God's will in the church add mysterious metaphors to this relationship, and dialogue goes through the philosophical pages of Plato and Pascal to explore the immortality of the soul, making winter history deep and moving.
