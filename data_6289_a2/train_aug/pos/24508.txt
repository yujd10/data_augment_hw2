The heroine's husband is so beautiful! Yes, the main plot of David and Claire is very complete, everything has happened, and the song is also very good, but from the beginning to the end, someone cares about him, who is just a straight man, can see that he loves heroin and loves children (it's really true to sleep on the couch with a child who is not his own).), completely accept the family of the lady's best friend, and even the best friend's husband is considered his own friend. The identity of men and women is also quite ok. This end gives a thoughtful expression, this character is not so functional.
