The most heaviest animation is a bit disgusting. The theme is always "Vallée du Vent" respect for nature, live in harmony with it, the feelings are always really moving. MiyazakiHayao uses this film to complain and resent human beings in the name of nature, which is deep and stimulating. P.s. The content of the animation should be a little more cooperative. Even if the show is ugly, there should not be scenes of decapitated hands and disgusting mugs. ★★★★★
