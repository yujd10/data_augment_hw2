This domestic animation is very beautiful. I repeat, it's really beautiful. This time, I was very lucky to have the opportunity to watch the film in advance. I didn't expect much of the film, but the result was completely unexpected. The creativity of Planet flour is so good that it incorporates many elements of Chinese style, including the types of pasta, language and so on. The most surprising is the animated characters, especially the protagonist ten cents, steam breads that sparkle and translucent texture bar.
