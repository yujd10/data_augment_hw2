Those who say this movie is a bad movie of the century and get a low score are all black fans, right? Former teammate fans? Teammate fans? Don't say my fan filter is thick, I can objectively evaluate it: although the editing of this movie is a bit chaotic and the plot lacks convergence, it's not so bad that it can't be seen on the set, and Zhang Yixing is definitely a bright place. Its strength on the big screen is beautiful, beautiful to choke, just here is worth the ticket price, and the baby is very cute!
