Jin Hena continues her ghost horse in "Do not believe her". I don't know why the title of the film adds the word "barbaric". Do you want to take advantage of "barbarism" to stimulate your popularity? But the teacher inside is not barbaric, ah, it seems that the students are more disobedient. In fact, there is no need to see the charm of the male and female actors themselves is enough to support a small piece of the sky.
