Classic black film, multi-line repetition of the flight process + the best part of the series of shootings. The dialogue is concise and fierce, and the rock soundtrack is absurd. Classic photo: the fire fighting room is covered with corpses, and the dog breaks in the ticket and floats all over the sky. Bad guys, women and dogs. Style affects Gellich and Quentin.
