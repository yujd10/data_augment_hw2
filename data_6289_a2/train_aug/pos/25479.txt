It is very depressing from beginning to end, and the incompetence of the police is the key to the delay in the resolution of the case. After the release of the main suspects, no one went to watch, and for those directly related to the case, they did not check their family history, relying entirely on evidence found inadvertently to solve the case. The title "prisoners" is very significant, and the end forces you to think about who the prisoner is.
