This version is the first movie on the list of gods that I saw when I was a child, so there are fans in it. I always thought it was really the list of gods, and everyone acted alive. Later, after watching the Legend of Nezha, I thought it was something. Until last year after the list of divinity of the bishop. It's a fucking classic.
