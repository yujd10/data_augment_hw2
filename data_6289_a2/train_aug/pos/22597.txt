Compared to geniuses or Darjeeling, the film focuses on individual transformation rather than family reconciliation. After all, the son dies easily, as if it were just a tool for the father to know each other (+ financial). This kind of film is like a placebo, telling you that it's not shameful to be a man-child, and you still have a chance to grow up.
