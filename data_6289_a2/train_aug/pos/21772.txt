For more than 30 percent of one or two stars, I also have to give four stars! There is no reference to the four stars of Need for Speed, otherwise this film will receive seven or eight stars! The title of the film is too easy to be misunderstood, just like the panting at the time! In fact, Old Joe has been very good in recent years, and his films are all unambiguous! Personally, I think the intention of this film is very obvious, that is, I mean, their old American hair has made a contribution in this area! But that's, isn't it?
