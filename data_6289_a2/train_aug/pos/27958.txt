The remake of the Spanish film "The Mystery of the Women's Body" (which is the same director as the "Invisible Guest"), the first half of the Spanish film is better and compact, the plot progresses step by step, and South Korea is a little messy. The second half of the film in South Korea is better, Spain makes a kind of strange relationship, and South Korea has improved the relationship very well, which seems more reasonable. I like this kind of great suspensive film.
