The first half was so depressed that I felt like I was about to get out of my many years of depression. Thinking of the long road and the possible difficulties, I really wanted to jump out of the building immediately. In the second half of the movie, the hostess is really pitiful. Her husband doesn't believe her, and she has to plead it. And the most terrifying part of the movie is the face of the heroine, who is so hideous that he looks like a skeleton.
