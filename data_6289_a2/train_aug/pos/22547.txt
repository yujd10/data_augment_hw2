A typical American action film. The inversion of the plot can no longer attract more popularity. However, Bruce's relaxed humor and the songs of Moscow taxi drivers' songs are very interesting. You can go to the movies to see the big car reversal scene and fierce fights. For me, who loves muscle men, it's very cool.
