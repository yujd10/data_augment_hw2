Thank you. The scale is really great, but fortunately I didn't finish it with my father.. The film seemed to bring me back to my childhood, at that time, but in fact I didn't have such a record, much less lived at that time. (Li Xiaojun is attached? it's too much like his embarrassing sentence. I only understand this sentence now.) I feel very true. The subdog wants to be a low-end Beijinger, but there are fewer courses and so on. I still have feelings in Beijing.
