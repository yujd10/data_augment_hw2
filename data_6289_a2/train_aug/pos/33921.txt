Apart from the hard wounds as if the physical structure and logical program of the robot can produce consciousness, store consciousness and how to transfer consciousness, I really like this film a lot. It's almost ethically discussing whether a conscious robot is still a robot. When the female bandit saw the robot as a newborn baby, the natural outbreak of maternal love was really touching. It's the best science fiction film I've seen so far this year.
