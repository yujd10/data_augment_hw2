Fassbender had such a warm film, which was not cold and hard at all, and was moved. The stereotype of others that can be seen everywhere in the crowd, the market spirit, and the subsequent vivacity were completely demonstrated by him. Fassbender's involvement in the role of Amy's son-in-law is extremely ironic.
