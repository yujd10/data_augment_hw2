The list of the best animations in my heart is about to be rearranged, and the tear glands collapse more than once or twice. MiyazakiHayao can put an end to it. He is always he, seeking excellence, standing on the point of view of truth, goodness and beauty rather than of the country and of the law, as a craftsman, living with tenacity and never abandoning his brush and his moral in his heart. Thank you, Dad!
