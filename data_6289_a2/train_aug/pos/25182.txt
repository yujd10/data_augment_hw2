A film sums up the life of Master Hongyi. First of all, in general, it is to deplore the lives of people, the circumstances of life, the sculpted character, even Shuton cannot be exempted from vulgarity. The children of a rich family, born in a side room, the young people of hot blood, advocating art, withdrawing from teaching, and hiding themselves as a monk. I think the interpretation of Pu Cunxin is particularly remarkable and the details are particularly exquisite. Whether it is filming itself or the sense of longevity brought by age, it is fascinating.
