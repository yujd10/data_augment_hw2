In fact, I want to play four and a half stars, because it always ends up in the Hollywood style. I haven't seen a dystopical social science movie that makes people feel at some point. I'm more and more moved by it. I don't care what colors are used alternately. It's shit. All I know is that we're all citizens of Happy Valley. Our colors are sprayed inside our bodies. Happy Valley can now be translated as Harmony Valley.
