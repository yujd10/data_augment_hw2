Until the last second after the last word ED, my heart was hung in my throat. The "Another" 1998 finally disappeared, and at night see Shanbei Middle School quietly wait for the next "Another". I very much agree with Saki Ming's point of view on interpersonal relationships. No matter how close the relationship has been, a person is a lonely individual after all, who can abandon others and be abandoned by others.
