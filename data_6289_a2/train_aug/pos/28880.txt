Sad, very sad, very sad. The dream is far away, the reality is cruel, and life is not easy. Even if you work hard and fight for survival, you can't succeed, and things often go against your wishes. History is quite true, but the details are a little false, too many lines of soul chicken soup, though reasonable, but not like the usual words, and a lot of "blow" flavor, not all feel inspiring. As a real actor, action is very important!
