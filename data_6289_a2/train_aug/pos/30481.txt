You can't be wrong to trust Snyder! Of course, as Cavell said, the film is completely the child of Snyder, and you can see the caricature manuscript to each mirror. OOC? No problem, what is shown here is the kal-el/clark growing to a loss and an unprepared period. There is not a mean zod of the year. I didn't see Nolan's satellite powder blowingwayne, but it was an unexpected surprise to see Lexcorp's oil tanker.
