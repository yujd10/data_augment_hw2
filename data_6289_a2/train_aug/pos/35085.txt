Kate Winslet's wonderful performance was ignored because of the director's sexual scandal?! The film is still in the style of "family melodrama" in Hollywood in the 1950s, photography is a living style of Douglas Seek, and Kate's character is a heroine Tennessee Tennessee Williams, specifically mentioned [streetcar desire] and [pink tattoo]. At the beginning of the film, see Douglas Seek's Spring Wind and Autumn Rain.
