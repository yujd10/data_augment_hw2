Needless to say, the amount of information is a little confused after reading, at least three brushes can fully understand it; the understanding of the aesthetic scale between cartoons and animation is perfect; the script is extremely precise to grasp the cultural characteristics of the different stages of American culture and of the different ethnic groups. Those who know some writing terms can only say that the script changes abruptly. I can only say that you really watch too few black films and have no understanding of American culture.
