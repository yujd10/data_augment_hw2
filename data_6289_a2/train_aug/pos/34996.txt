I think it looks good. Or Hao is so beautiful, although the whole film is still unreasonable in some places, but I think there's nothing wrong with the tone and the overall atmosphere. Finally, or Hao said: I love you in my life, I'm really moved. People without humanity can do anything. The feelings of teenagers and girls are extremely touching, the scene of holding hands on the subway, the hands are green, hard to love.
