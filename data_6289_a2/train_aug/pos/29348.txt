The anti-war feeling of the entire film is very strong in the film of the Second World War directed by the Germans. The emphasis is not on war, but on the great transformation of several major characters from their arrival in Stalingrad to the whole perspective of war and life. Each scene is just for 140 minutes, and photography is also good. In short, the madness of the last characters, suicide and so on, like the Deer Hunter, is a deep torture of the Second World War. 4.5 stars.
