I have to say that it is very convenient to make movies at home in South Korea. The plot is constantly pushed to the best part. It doesn't make sense if you don't cry. From time to time, the point of crying is a mixture of warmth and a little laugh, which is a little closer to the rhythm of the heart. People are social and family animals living in this world. No matter what kind of film it is, people will always be moved. And then there is the long shot in the film, which is really good to capture characters and create an environment.
