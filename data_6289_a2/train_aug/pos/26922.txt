Sister Nagazawa was so beautiful. I haven't finished watching the TV version yet. I finished watching the version of the movie first. Moriyama was really out of taste at first, but the more I saw it, the more I loved it. Charming wonderful. Clothing and bags are in love! It's a good story, too. Look! I love the design at the end of the movie too!
