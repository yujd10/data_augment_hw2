A very long film. Video and audio are all my favorites, and the last highway and train are very beautiful, but this film is without love after seeing it. Faced with the chains of humble human nature, we have no choice but to sing the last song on the instinct of animals, because we can endure great sufferings? However, it is once again clear that Setits' "character determines destiny". A life of being insulted and victimized.
