The film is good for me. Just to say one thing, many people complain about magic medicine. In fact, it seems to me that this medication is only a way for the director or author to promote the plot. It may not be medicine but something like a mirror or something. This original work may not be based on real events, but similar incidents of killing themselves by mental control exist in Japan, so it's not bullshit.
