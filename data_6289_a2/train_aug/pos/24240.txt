I haven't seen much of the movie by Huang Xiaoming. I think it's pretty good. Except to be beautiful, the others look like bandits. But once again, there may also be beautiful guys in bandits, and the cave is a little messy, which may not be easy to explain, and the scene of the explosion behind it is not real enough.
