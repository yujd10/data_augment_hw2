[140129] This is called a Chinese horror film, full of feelings. After all, it is not a fan of zombie film. I feel that the editing in some places is not very clear on the plot. For example, I do not understand why the Taoist three-legged priest went to get the body of Uncle Dong. In the end, he only understood it after watching Douyou's analysis. No, no, no. The horror game in front is very scary, and the return makes people feel good, high-quality works.
