A very interesting comedy, that is, at the beginning there were too many male characters, and they were blind. I did not understand the characters until I saw 1/3. The United States are so open. The national conditions are too different. Finally, there was sophie. Big colored egg! To sum up the film in five words is the counterattack of the loser.
