Good scriptwriter, good story. Interspersed with the love story is my favorite tone, there is no gentle conversation, no preflower willow, nothing more, take the gun, throw the weapon and take you everywhere in the mountains to catch a white cock. There is no truth in the film, but there is a human struggle to resist compromise and reconciliation. 2013.7.2 Goa,Anjuna.
