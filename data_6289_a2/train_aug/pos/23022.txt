James Grey's script is always much less than his emotions, the description of emotions is really first class, the emotion comes first, the story doesn't matter. It's not Lover's story at all. On the surface, there are two lovers, but who is true love? I don't see the answer. But I believe one now: if you say I love you to the other person and the other person doesn't have feedback, then this sentence can be left to the next person.
