The forehead is a little slow, the back is very good, there are jokes and feelings, Disney still likes to make this kind of antique film, the final battle with the symphony has a great feeling.

Always can't help complain, in front of a group of dead, behind a hail of bullets no one has been hurt, really told us that luck is also a kind of strength!
