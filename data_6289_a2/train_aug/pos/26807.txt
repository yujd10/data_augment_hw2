The creation of the atmosphere of terror and suspense is similar to the "Baby of Rosemary", which is the terror aggravated by the invasion of private space. The atmosphere is commendable, the characters are full (the woman from strong to weak and David's transformation from weak to strong), and it is interesting to use publishing to strengthen psychological changes. The scene of rape is particularly sexy, and the creation of conflict and digestion at the end of the confrontation can be called wonderful. Dustin Hoffman is a good actor. 4.5 stars.
