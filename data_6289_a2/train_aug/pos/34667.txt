Since Douban's score is quite low, everyone can complain, but I admit that the three protagonists love him very much. I'm surprised that this police story is quite different from the previous plot at the end. Maybe the plot itself is not worth playing 5 stars, but like a family movie plus Jackie Chan's great performance and the very sensational song, I like it very much.
