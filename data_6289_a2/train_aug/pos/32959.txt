The image is very beautiful, praises wind of ink, after looking at it, I want to sit down and wait for the wallpaper table, it is as good as Xin Haicheng. The terraces, mountain streams and other landscapes that the little prince and his master crossed were extremely beautiful. But the plot is a little too much, and the end is too perfunctory. I wonder if it would be better to gather the 20 minutes lost. In fact, some characters are also described deeply, and there are a lot of memories, but they do not play a role in the plot.
