More than 20 years ago, when the Science Fiction World Pictorial was presented, it was deeply attracted. Unfortunately, the great format of the "Science" edition came to an end. Today, the Taiwanese version is a collection in the library, with a little irreparable melancholy and regret. Friends who have not seen it can not understand the classics of this work. Then there is the film "Alita", which is too naive in narrative and thought, and perhaps no audience will be interested in this original comic strip outside of printing because of the film. This time Cameron and Rodriguez really bought money to return the pearl.
