My favorite part of the trilogy! The old man is really cute! Never get tired of seeing! The relationship between father and son, the conversation about the Zeppelin, we did not speak correctly in 20 years, I never hold you back, son! River young joys really burst, beautiful earthquake ah. Must be handed over to the museum, meet Hitler, the castle out of trouble, Max can speak more than a dozen foreign languages, it will disappear without trace, should be handed over to the museum, and finally: let him go! Son, overcome your inner desires.
