The main motivations that support me after reading are "see how stupid Koreans can be" and "Jason Morma, do you want to be so cool and beautiful? the protagonist has been stolen from halo by you"! Play another star for Jason Morma, the man with talking eyes, the most beautiful villain in history, the king of horses in the song of ice and fire, countless women abandon the song of ice and fire because he's dead. It doesn't make sense that such a man is not popular! It's a little Depp, probably because they're all Hawaiians.
