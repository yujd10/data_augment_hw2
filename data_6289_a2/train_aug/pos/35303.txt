Professor Snape's sacrifice brought tears to my eyes. The audience applauded at the end of the film. As a fan of ashes, I really want to give six stars. Thanks to Harry and Rowling. I am very happy to have your company for ten years. By the way, at the time of the decisive battle, I thought Harry was not disabled, but still very beautiful! The film even exceeded the book for the first time, I think.
