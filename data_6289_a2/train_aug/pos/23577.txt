I never understood the meaning of using 3D in such a fashion film. I did not regret not having had any difficulty finding a show until I saw it. It is as if the magnificent scene as cold as a cage and the musical interpretation that crosses it are all refreshing. There is nothing to comment on the plot, concise, cruel and real, the feelings of the scene will be integrated into the performance, always in the heart.
