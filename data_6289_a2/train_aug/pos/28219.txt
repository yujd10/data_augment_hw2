Overall, it can be said that the degree of reduction of the comic book is the highest among the three versions of Spider-Man. Boss put to a high praise, not a completely bad person, the fighting efficiency is not particularly high, very suitable for the bug this young superhero pro-people. And because of what I saw in BFI, the 3D effect is excellent, adding a star.
