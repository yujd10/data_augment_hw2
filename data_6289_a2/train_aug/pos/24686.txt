Fluid finish Cloclo life, no urine point. His own music is excellent, as well as the soundtrack of the genius of Desplat music (the thematic melody of BGM is epic, recommended). Of course, the weird one has become a legend of his genius, and Clo is a representative of the musical madness of obsessive-compulsive perfectionism. The whole film exerts the profound influence of the father on Clo's life! There is still a life of weeding the old one and bringing out the new one, and constantly learning other musical styles is the main point of his legendary success. I always thought he was going to die of overwork, but as a result.
