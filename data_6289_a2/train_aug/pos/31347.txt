How can I have a good relationship with my parents? Since I was a child, I wanted to be a leader to improve people's lives. I found that the leaders were only the plot of politicians, and there was nothing to say about serving people. Chinese really bear with everything. Not admitting the right things, not admitting injuries, not admitting mistakes, but taking the initiative to admit mistakes. I don't want that!
