Oh, my God, Hopkins has played Hitchcock so cute! I also went to see Psycho especially for this film, the masterpiece! The director takes the shooting of Psycho as a starting point to show the life of the master suspense before and behind the scenes, and the dialogue is also very humorous. There are still people who think that the goddess's breasts are too big! I will never find a Hitchcock blonde as beautiful as you. Mirren and Hopkins are expected to be nominated for an Oscar.
