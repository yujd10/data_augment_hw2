Use a large number of recent scenes to frame the aquatic face in the image, through its perspective and the "connotation" revealed on its face to show the destruction of people by the Shanghai gangs at that time. The tone is always misty, like a layer of ashes in the heart of the individual. The sunset in the countryside and the scene as a small bridge and running water let the public breathe a sigh of relief from depression. But one after the other. The last oblique image in the film implies that Cuihua's daughter has the same destiny as Jinbao.
