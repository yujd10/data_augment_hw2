I cannot understand the logic of "saying first." First, the female master has no idea of "putting in place" to change the masculine master at all. Everything has been said to be imperceptible; second, everyone has his own ideas, and the other person with whom you agree cannot necessarily agree with you, just like you and I now, if you are here to influence the evaluation of the characters by people, how do you have the right to guide the behavior of the female master? Second, will the male lead a good way of living in the future? A person who is not good to deal with people, no friends, no lovers, no descendants, eventually his parents die marginalized by society, no considerable work, no income, and finally like committing a crime or ending up depressed? That's your opinion? Besides, how many people will you meet in your life that will change you, from your parents to an old man who makes a cercue, or you get out of the stone and have mature thoughts?
