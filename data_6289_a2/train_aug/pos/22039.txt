It's hard to say? Depp is one of the rare films that can see his appearance complete, clear and clean. But it's still an extra-marital affair. It's a kind of biography. Someone told me that he fell asleep. Look at this. But in general, he describes the acts of a child writer, but no matter how pure and brilliant the photo is, as long as there is Depp, there's always a dark breath.
