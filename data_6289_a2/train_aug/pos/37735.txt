I don't remember the other things I saw when I was a child. I still remember the classic scenes of this film, such as the sucking of the brain, being captured by flying insects, shooting and killing my own people, Zerg's siege base, spitting fire, the classic bomb, etc. This film gives me a dream of being a soldier and a pilot.
