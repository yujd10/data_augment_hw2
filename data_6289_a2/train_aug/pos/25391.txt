There are no miracles, but you'll get what you deserve. It's a shame for a talented girl to give up her talent, like when Mitsui found out her style was weak. The man and the woman don't know why they don't call much, and Hiromo Ryoko is so old that he becomes ordinary. I like that ending very much. Everyone plays table tennis with different moods. For example, Miss News shouldn't turn around when the plane leaves.
