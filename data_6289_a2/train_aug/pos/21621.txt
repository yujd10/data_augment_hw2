Although he has never been immersed in various Star Trek TV movies in the United States, the two films that focus on the launch are also very interesting. I really can't stand the rotten girls and boys who talk about gay love. Now, as long as it's a film with two men as the protagonists, it's not gay. I wipe it once or twice. I'm not tired of making every movie like that, and I'm not tired of playing with the rest of the others.
