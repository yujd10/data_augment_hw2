I love it very much. It's my favorite film since the beginning of the year. No matter the director, the photograph, the screenwriter, the image and other aspects of quality are very good. The difficult hostess and her hard men. It's touching. When the best friend's marriage becomes her own funeral, then becomes the wedding of the hostess; the weapons left by lovers who died in battle; her only women's clothes, before and after becoming a hero. Persevering pain, joy is unforgettable, war has life in addition to death. Even heroes are victims of war, not to mention ants.
