DOX screen painting, followed again, so much like this film that I don't tire of watching it several times ~ gothic style, dark tone, weird music and atmosphere are all good! (PS: the translation quality of the different television stations varies, and the CCTV version is OK, at least "Bad Bourne" was used.)
