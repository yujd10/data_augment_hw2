Wang Zuxian really played the ghost in a fairy, Wu Qihua is also very elegant, Yuan Biao and Wu Ma are very funny, and the nine-tailed fox is also very pitiful. Overall, I have a good understanding of the story, and it's also the movie of an amazing woman in the fourth painting I've seen recently. Although this film is not as smooth as Qian's ghost in the plot and action, it's still a very good movie, beauty.
