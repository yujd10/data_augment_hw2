This film probably has empathy, and what you don't understand is really incomprehensible. The hostess is a complete representation of me, the feeling of tipping between fantasy and reality, always a stranger, pretending to be high-minded and sensitive to all the movements of others, being ashamed by others, ruining all sadly and indignant. Finally, the feeling that I can't come down. The hostess finally embraced reality, but now I can't do it.
