It is a pity that I did not see the villa Marapat during my high-end trip to Capri last year / the dynamic interpretation of the building with the camera at the end is excellent / the overall use of high-end Italian colors in the film is chic and extremely elegant / it is also the most rhythmically comfortable in Godal movies that I have ever seen.
