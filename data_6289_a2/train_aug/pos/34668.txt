During the summer vacation in the first year, the New Oriental teacher showed Shawn the sheep for a few minutes. I liked it very much at that time. I couldn't wait impatiently for this film, and I wasn't disappointed at all at the end! Without a single line, he can make people dream of vomiting blood!
