Maybe Pirates of the Caribbean is not a very stimulating job, but he taught me at least that you have to wait for the lights to turn off on the screen to watch a movie-I wonder if anyone noticed that there is a story of less than a minute after the end of the first movie. changed the fate of a very important character in the play. Haha, so be sure to wait for the end next time, there might be a surprise!
