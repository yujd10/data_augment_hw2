Nervous of suffering throughout the vision of the film, Hanks once again conquered me, the sense of substitution made me feel that it is not a film, it is a real event, the collision between civilization and barbarism, only to see the subtitle at the end of the film, I found that it was really a real person adapted from a real event, adding ripples to my heart.
