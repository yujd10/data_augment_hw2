Three and a half stars. There is no Stinger at the end of the movie, so you don't have to wait for subtitles to end up in the movies. JB, Twilight, Asian Americans, pedophiles and other American-nautical parodies have been shot. The director must love American television culture of the 1980s, all kinds of tributes, like Rider music, etc. A film stacked with jokes of dialogue, to be honest, otherwise the bear is cute, it is completely 3 stars. Everyone cares, and it's enough to feel comfortable after reading it.
