618 Night 1830 Film Festival @ Cathay Pacific is not over, it's over today. There's something different to watch from old movies in the old cinema. The memories of young people in the city. Although there's always a deviation in memory, it's hard to avoid lies, but the passage of reality and illusion, like the contrast between funerals and peacocks, is entangled in mind. Wherever you go, a corner of heart will be occupied.
