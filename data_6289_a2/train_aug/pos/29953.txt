It turned out to be so easy to frame, not to consider the height, ah, the knife cut in the direction to judge the size of the killer. There is also the investigation about the relationship between people around, and so on, how so easy to erase the name, it is a bit difficult to understand. PS: I don't know French, but there are many places that don't seem to mean that.
