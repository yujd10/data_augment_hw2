Ha, the German colonel is the most interesting. They call me Earhart of the concentration camp! This is one of the best films of the Second World War! Witty and spirit, not only makes people feel the tension caused by the clouds of war and the shadow of Nazi death, but also defeats it four or two times. When he was in the enemy camp, he still did not forget that the husband and wife were jealous and molested by the Nazis.
