Hulk needs a hug, and so do I. Depending on the current state of human science and technology development, Malthus' theory can still be used in another hundred years. Traditional anti-Marvel ending, although very angry, but still to be rented. Marvel is not easy to make money in the next decade. Marvel has a very special affection for this film, and Marvel finally has a sense of epic poetry through time and space. A special memory, Loki by Tom Hiddleston.
