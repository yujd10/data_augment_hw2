4-4.5 loves the tone of the image, retro and a somewhat malicious feeling, this combination of virtual and real is the best part of me, but there are two factors that make my pleasure not reaching the extreme, one is that the answer to the riddle is revealed too early, and the other is that it is somewhat inconsistent to put fictional history on a real character, but what is remarkable in this film is that it shows a sense of the beauty of poetry and novel, and the soundtrack is really charming.
