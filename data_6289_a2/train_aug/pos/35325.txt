A secret about two people who are alone at the bottom. It is a forest island, it is a carnival in the rain. It is also a film that is difficult to describe, passers-by know it tacitly and smile at each other. The director is a genius out there, and the details, the edition, the soundtrack and the frame are all endowed with a deeper meaning-perhaps the person who is calmly watching the film has a lonely soul buried in the depths.
