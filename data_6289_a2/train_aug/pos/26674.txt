Chibi divided into upper and lower episodes is good, because the audience is familiar with the whole story, this divided into upper and lower episodes is indeed a suicidal idea. But it doesn't make sense that the score of this film is inferior to that of the Macao Fengyun by Fatty Wang 2. As for the question of waiting, everyone's requirement for Wang Jing is much weaker. It's just a laugh, but it's different for John Woo.
