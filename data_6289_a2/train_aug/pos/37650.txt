I saw this film on December 11, the first scene in China, and the whole film revealed a strong taste of Beijing. Wu Yifan in the film had a playful look in his eyes, and his acting talents were laudable, from Tan Xiaofei with silver hair in the first half of the film. to the teenager in black clothes and hair in the second half, and at the end of the film in front of the old gun running on the ice, although he did not say a word. Resolved eyes, the strength of the muscles massage and the falling tears are all convincing.
