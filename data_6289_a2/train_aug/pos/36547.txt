When I think of a short Tango animation film, everything is chaotic but linked to each other, and only in a modern comedy, we can feel both a sense of presence and the utopian illusion of high repeated sensory. The composition of the whole is first class, and the perfect planning of the scene makes the plot smooth. Several angles of photography are very similar to Hope's Night Ranger. I can't help but think of the sense of alienation between the people represented in Hope's paintings. It is difficult for people in the modern space to be exposed to the camera. At the same time, even if the person is close through a layer of glass, the light projected by the artificial light source of the inner city is full of ghosts, so that the outside observer seems to be in the dark, forming a great contrast.
