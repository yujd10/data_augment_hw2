The titles Asako I and Asako II are these two personalities presented by the girls in front of two masculine masters. Several scenes emphasize the key action of the "gaze", and the point chosen by the film is very delicate and precise. It seems that after "I no longer count on you" and "I no longer trust you", I find my own rhythm. Empty and nothing, strange and ghostly, absurd and subtle, like the charm of the film "Ecstasy".
