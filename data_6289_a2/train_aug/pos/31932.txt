The best movie lately. Feelings are sincere and touching. Whitewash the American capitalist class has a good sense of justice. In other words, it's really a disaster, ah, why go back ah, do with it, it would be nice to create a new York. Thank you Donald Trump at the end of the movie. You borrowed someone's house, right? Great spirit must be saved.
