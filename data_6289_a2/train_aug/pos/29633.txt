The rhythm is as calm as a mountain stream, and the gentle flow has been decided. I saw the fatty castle for the first time, and once again saw Jacques Merlin's ceremonial wig before his death and the painful drops of blood flowing from his hair after dozens of bullets. Jacques Merlin seems to have been filmed by the director as a hero like Guevara. The speed of the speech is too fast and the pronunciation is vague. I don't hear anything. Sigh.
