First of all, the story is still wonderful, compared to the previous work Beng Junhao also improved. These are also class differences. Li Cangdong hides needles in his heart, while Feng Junhao hides a knife in his smile. The "truth" in the comedy is even more naked, laughs and laughs, and those who can't laugh are the power of the film.
