The Sullivan scene teaching Helen Keller to eat with a knife and a fork left me with a deep impression. At first, I didn't know what they were doing. I saw the two entangled there all the time, with a long shot and a description. I finally realized that she was teaching Helen to eat. I have to admire their performance. What most impressed Helen was that when Helen wanted to say "Water" through the well, she really understood what Sullivan was doing teaching her spelling, teaching her to feel the world, and logic and the connection. She finally realized that Professor Sullivan was teaching her to learn and know the world. Because for a blind, deaf and stupid person, she didn't know why she liked animal training, but instinctively compromised and obeyed. This time she understood and felt like she suddenly woke up. I'm so happy for her.
