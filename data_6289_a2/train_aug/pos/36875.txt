The last 40 minutes, too hot, will be full of controversies and dramas of the Olympic basketball history of 1972, filmed in a legendary human epic! The result can be clearly seen from the profile of the name, but then what? The process is always thrilling, boiling blood, eyes filled with tears, draining completely, there is no way not to applaud. The director's planning, the conception of conflict and the control of rhythm can not be better ah, under the postulate of ensuring absolutely a high degree of reduction, through the treatment of the art of the film to release tension, I am completely blown. I believe that no matter who plays basketball or those who do not understand basketball, there is no way to reject his spirit of inheritance. Originally, it is competitive, it is team sport, it is the charm of basketball, it is the human nature that we all face against-current perseverance.
