Oscar's psychological description is not very clear; except for the suppression of sexual orientation caused by the shadow of childhood, other personality descriptions are more vague - the director's expression of the emotional state is stronger than the representation of the complete character (which is also the climax of action and photography) the hamster's conversation is humorous and brings out lonely sadness.
