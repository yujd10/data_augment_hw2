I talked about Melville with my friends yesterday. I watched this film while it was hot today. I liked it a lot in the first half-hour, and the deployment on the back wasn't as amazing as before, but it was still wonderful. Recently, the five stars were a little bit one after the other. I don't know if we should be lucky to meet a good film or because the aesthetic standard was lowered. --
