The score is not very high. I really like the opposite game of Takuya Kimura and Yami Nagazawa. It is said that it is the work of Keigo Higano, although I did not read this one, it is not bad. A composition of small story, gradually restore the original appearance of the affair, the end always gives each piece a little paperweight shot deliberately ah, not so surprised. I think there must be three stars, plus one for the star pair. Tut-tout, I don't know where to insert the beautiful straw.
