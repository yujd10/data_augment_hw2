In this film, Zhang Guoli's accent and performance look a lot like Chen Jianbin. Wow, Mr. Zhang, who has been around for over 00 years, is still very charming. Remember this line: when you were young, you didn't have the courage to be a thief; when you're old, you have the courage to be a thief, but the thief has gone. Personally, I can accept this way of life.
