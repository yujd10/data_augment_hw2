Eight points! Definitely in the top 10 of my favorite comedy movie! Oranges with apples, no one has to lose ~ the big family is noisy, usually feel really boring, but really melt in, but you can also find the warmth. This film is basically based on national characteristics, but the criterion is very good, and the remedy is full. And it doesn't always like filling dirty jokes like comedies in recent years, and it seems very clean.
