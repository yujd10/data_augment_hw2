The process is very complete, the end is very bad, perhaps the tragic end does not meet the expectations of my heart. P.s. After watching the king of the struggle, I suddenly feel that the sad end of this film is actually very good, there is not so many "sleugehammer crushing" to put an end to your glory, there is not so much flashy need to pay the price of life. She died quietly, but got the sublimation of the soul, no life without death is the best future, is the right depth.
