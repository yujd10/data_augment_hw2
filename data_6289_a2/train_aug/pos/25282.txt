A parallel history of the United States, from Watergate to the legalization of homosexual marriage, is interpreted by famous actors. If you wear too much makeup, you can hide your acting talents and not produce the best actor and actress and support role. But Bell, Adams, Carell and Rockwell are all the great stars I've seen many times. Back in the film, although the vice-president is very resourceful and wild of war, he insists on his sexual orientation to withdraw from the presidential election for the benefit of his younger daughter, and secretly supports his public opposition to homosexual marriage for the career of his older daughter in politics. Complex human nature.
