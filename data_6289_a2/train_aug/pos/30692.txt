I really like this kind of English humor! Brad pitt's accent can't be understood without subtitles. All sorts of coincidences are exaggerated and funny. However, too many characters as a facial recognition obstacle means a lot of pressure. I really think Benicio Del Toro and Brad Pitt are very similar.
