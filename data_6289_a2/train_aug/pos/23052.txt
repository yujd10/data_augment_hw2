The fiercest serial killer caught in Soviet history was arrested at a time when the regime changed and was almost pardoned by Yeltsin. The atmosphere of the HBO scene is excellent. Had it not been for Bao Xiaoqiang's father and the Ravens with three eyes, listening to the strange English all the time, I would have thought it was a Soviet dubbing film.
