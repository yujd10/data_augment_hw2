After reading the 2019 edition of Nezhu, I thought that the old version was even more precious. Maybe it was because I was old. "There is an irreducible contradiction in the central part of Nezha: eviscerate and swallow the flesh, bring the red lotus back to life, return everything to you, and do not get involved - it is not a relationship that can be brought together, it is not a complete story with a place for the meeting. Behind the word "Nezhu" is a deep hatred, a primitive and naive free individual who betrays the injustice and injustice that is inflicted on him and gives irreparable self-tuture."
