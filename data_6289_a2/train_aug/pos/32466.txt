Unannouncedly, the power to hold the film was so strong that it depressed the audience until death. Norton played well, but compared to hard guys like Colin Farrell, Noah Emmerich and John Walter, his police uniform did not match his bookish style. I still like to see him get a good score. Up to now, Norton's film is almost finished.
