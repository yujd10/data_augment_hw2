It is revisited after seeing Longmen Flying Armor, the first is dazzling waterfalls and countless secret weapons, blindly pursuing visual effects, but cannot remember a classic character. The latter is on the ground or even a simple hand-to-hand fight, but Wu Junru is funny, Hu Hu Huizhong's heroic posture and Hui Yinghong's competitive character are all unforgettable. Hope that the development of science and technology can allow Brother Chun to shoot a film. I don't know if it's the sadness of martial arts movies. Classic, just two words!
