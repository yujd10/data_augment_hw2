The famous literary film 3p, even in 1962, Trevor could still show that I loved the relationship between Joe and Jim. Catherine, who was crazy about them, bothered me so much. If she was the heroine of Budapest's love and many men commit suicide for her, I would like to see that Catherine's selfishness and disinterestedness change so quickly that she does not see her out of love.
