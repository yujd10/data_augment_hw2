Today, when I saw the photos of friends in Guilin playing in their hometown and the statues of the third sister Liu and brother A Niu, I suddenly felt the desire to see this old film again. I don't remember when I first saw it, but now I see it again with this nostalgia, but it's a different flavor, if it's a beautiful water of native town, this evil of the country is both beautiful and sad.. Guilin, my dear native city, have you ever known how much I miss you?
