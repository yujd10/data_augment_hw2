I watched the second part first, ah, after watching the first one, and then watching the second one, it was strange, but obviously I didn't like it as much as I saw it when I first saw it. I love Nana so much. I love Mika Nakajima a lot. Oh, my God, this is the first modern Japanese romantic movie I saw.
