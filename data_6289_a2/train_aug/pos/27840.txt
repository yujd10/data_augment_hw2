It is not as bad as 5.8. The plot is really nothing new, there is no suspensive follow-up, but there is no weakness. As a criminal film, the film does not explain the motivations of criminals, nor does it analyse, because the author is here to tell the story of revenge, to think in the sense of life, and to reflect on the reward that good and evil deserve.
