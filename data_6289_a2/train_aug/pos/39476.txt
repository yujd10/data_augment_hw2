That's all for William. Don't expect a mentally handicapped fan to mark rationally. Although he plays such a role, sometimes laugh reminds people of himself. In the end, I don't want Nicholas to die, but I feel sad. He can be considered as coming from Amway, which is the song of "borrow and return". It's a beautiful piece. All of a sudden, I wonder what he's been through and how he likes to "borrow and pay back".
