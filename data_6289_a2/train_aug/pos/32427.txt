If it is love, why is it suffocating? It should be the feeling of blooming flowers in the spring. What is our love? Bondage is the love you want, imprisonment is the love I give you, the only thing I can do is to keep it tight. However, the tighter the tie is, the more alienated, the more indiscreet hugs and kisses, the slower our world collapses. Looking at your dream, even the light is tangled, our world darkens. But love gives, I have no choice, even if I have no blue sky anymore.
