The king finally sees the king! Tell the warmest and most beautiful feelings with the most violent and brutal stories, but pass on the most heartbreaking despair. It is a rare cult fantasy film in a Chinese-language film. Zhou Xingchi and Tsui Hark realize the "Chinese Dream Star Wars" that Zhang Yimou tried to realize through the Great Wall: build a truly oriental commercial IP series.
