I thought it would be the same as Uncle's long-legged books I read in high school. It was a tender story that someone kept silently and accompanied you to grow up. Since childhood, my mysterious uncle looks at you little by little, sending you a bouquet of flowers when you're sad, and jumping on the envelope to encourage you when you're happy. But this movie makes the story of dad long legs touching and sad. It's a secret love story.
