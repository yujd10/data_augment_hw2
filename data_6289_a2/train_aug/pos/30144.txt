Ben San is not terrible. Hong Kong-flavor chicken soup is terrible. The two women who are "in their thirty years" diametrically interpret opposite attitudes and feelings. There is a high contrast between "love" and "music". Directly attacks the resonance caused by the growing feeling of self-crisis and personal reflection. The story of the growth of "empathy" and the psychological critique of "precision and delicacy". Perhaps the whole way through difficulties, exhausted; but also to keep the courage to overthrow the past and start from scratch.
