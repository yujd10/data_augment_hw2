The word is poor. It's so great that I don't know how to praise it. The means and details to create suspense such as horror visualization / sound effects are perfect, and the best are the real building of character and emotional core, sincere emotion, firm courage and pure love must be able to overcome fear. It is also the constant humanist care in Jin Yeh's works, which is so touching.
