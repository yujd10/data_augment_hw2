This kind of plot is completely mentally delayed to death ~ if it wasn't for the final happy ending ~ this movie can't even rank for 0 points, the hero is so fleshy, why do you want to be a background? And why does the hero want to be with the uncle? Is this the so-called unique reservation for life? PS: the poster has nothing to do with the content! I thought it was a wild western movie in the background.
