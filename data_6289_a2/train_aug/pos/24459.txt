I love this film very much. I didn't expect it to be so interesting before watching it. The most impressive thing is that I don't have a human vagina, so you don't sleep with me, so I cut out the fish tail and replace it with a human vagina and legs to please you. The first thing to do with this kind of size surgery is to go to bed-- it's so cool! I love the design of the fish tail, which is very realistic and reveals a smell of fish. The conversation between sirens is also very interesting. Brother Jakub is so beautiful. It's strange that such an advanced film still turns sex in a way that can be seen all year round, and the design of the fish tail is not at all good. Or is there not enough money? It reveals the strong temperament of lack of money at any time.
