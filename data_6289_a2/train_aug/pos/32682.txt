In fact, it's a very light film, but I like the way your motorcycles ride at the end of the road, the vast bright fields, the large expanses of clouds, the bright light. And your hallucinations, your fragility and your prudence by turning off the fire, you whispered, I love you. But there was no answer. People say that God's favorite people die when they are young. You said your work would survive you. -in River.
