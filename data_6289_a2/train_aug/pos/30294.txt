It's so interesting that it's different from any West I've ever seen. Literary drama is excellent, and the four excellent male actors naturally explore life between their actions, flourishing their philosophy one by one. Although they don't lose the beautiful beauty of the West, they depict characters and times in detail, they go through the process of civilization, testify to the loyalty of rivers and lakes, and finally return to the warmth of the family.
