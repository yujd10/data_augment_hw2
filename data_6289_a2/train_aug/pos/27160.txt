I just saw Arthur 3 yesterday, which is obviously a child-style film. The child of the bad guy becomes a good boy with the help of the good boy ~ but I still like the appearance of the bad guy in the mini kingdom, especially Princess Selinia's brother did not find it to be a French film. The degree of grace of the image is good.
