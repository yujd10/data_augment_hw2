It is simply a contemporary biblical fable, a holy sculptural face, a face of piety of the holy heart, that it resembles God. It has passed through classes, through ages, and has traversed all sensitive beings, looking calmly and gently, even if destiny had never treated it fairly, and did not complain about this dark world. Italian film has its special magic at all times, and this director is very talented.
