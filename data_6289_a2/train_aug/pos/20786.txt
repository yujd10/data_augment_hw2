Sorentino is comparable to Li it in the expressive force of the camera, just like the Mu said that whales suck ao throw, livestock ghosts and snake gods, which is not enough to create a fantasy for her. Seeking revenge for her father is the most focused on the story, but it is still in the form of prose, like the children who play table tennis in the film, so it is right to give up the story and turn to Fellini. Yet, this film is still interesting and pleasant.
