It's super fun, and the visual effects are super great. Freddie's discussion and fight is my favorite, and I don't accept the rebuttal. It's rare for Freddie to meet his opponent and have a good time. Think about the scene of Hercules vs. Scorpion Killer in Scorpion Warriors. Finally, Jason came out with Freddie's head, and Freddie blinked at the audience, who was the biggest colored egg in the Freddie series. 20181023, always shocking.
