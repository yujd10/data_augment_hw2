Long Kiss and ML are both too beautiful and too pleasant. Their looks are usually more and more tasty, and their wives like to take the initiative. Relative writers think it is more aggressive. The interview and the truth in the film are actually pretty good, and the director has a strong literary and artistic flavour.
