Under the still high level of photography, this season seems to have tried to permeate viewers with a message of darkness and despair, especially in episode 9 Heroic. As if eating chronic poison, constantly eroding the body and mind. But the hope of the last three episodes is like an antidote, especially in the last half hour of the final of the season, which makes people scared and trembling nervously. Finally, the characters in the play and the audience in front of the screen are saved. It must be said that writers and directors are very good to control the emotions of the audience, and after removing 33 episodes, the appearance of the last episode of the season came like a flood.
