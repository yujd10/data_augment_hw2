Perhaps everyone's attitude towards life is different, some people only for temporary enthusiasm, some people for long-term planning and some people just for the sense that is enough. This film reminds me of "Ronny&I", who looked back at the tenderness that has never changed countless times, moved, and is once again attracted to this film.
