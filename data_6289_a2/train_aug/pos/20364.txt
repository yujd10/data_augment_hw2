In fact, I don't like this story, it's too bloody, but I understand why I still quietly see the end of the story that I don't like. Because it's so beautiful, when I saw "Hero" N years ago, I would say, at least the picture is very beautiful. But after seeing Uncle Gong's works, I think Master Zhang won't be able to pull that kind of beauty in ten years. It's strange that hand-made paintings are more fascinating than the famous mountains and rivers photographed.
