The first part of 20140111jtthe mother's castle must be seen together. Childhood anecdotes in the bright sun, prose, narrative, warmth and typical French humor, great love. A lot of things in the film, I had a similar experience in my childhood, so it resonates a lot. In childhood, everyone can feel that his father is omniscient and invincible, and it is only when we find that this is not the case that we really start to grow up.
