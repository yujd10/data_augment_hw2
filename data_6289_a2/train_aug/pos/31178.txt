Making horror movies like Mad Max is Wen Ziren's skill! It's the only horror movie that can make me cry. It's maybe the family is too poor, the exorcism couple can be too touching, or it can be too scary. The whole high-energy journey, one wave after the other, really exciting, it's not a roller coaster, my ship will crash QAQ called Wen Ziren as a contemporary master of terror. It's like a tsunami.
