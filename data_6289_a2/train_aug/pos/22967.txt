The scenery of the entire film is still very beautiful, although it is the last glory of the Tang dynasty, it still shows the sense of majesty of the higher kingdom of China at that time. There are indeed gaps in style and character lines, but after reading it, I feel that it is not as bad as 3.5 points.
