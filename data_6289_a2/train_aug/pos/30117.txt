In life, you have to go bravely on the road of your own choice, and there is no turning back. Each character has a distinct personality, except Kuroki Mingsha, a girl with soy sauce. Not all movies need conspiracy, and not all movies need to show high intelligence. And this movie without conspiracy and no high IQ, I think it's worth watching again.
