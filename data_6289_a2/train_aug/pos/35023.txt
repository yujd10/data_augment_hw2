The man in black 3 will be released on May 25th. I am thinking of the film that always turns me on in 1997. It's a funny pseudo-fiction film that doesn't need logic. The last image has become a classic, the earth is only one of countless lockers on the vast platform of the universe, there must be a higher life in which space looks at us.
