The words and the plot and the perfect integration, the exhibition of the first half of the aunt's life, the high tide, very capable of capturing the impression of the audience, the talents of a tour actor are so good, no wonder that aunt loves her so much. Show yourself in the eyes of your aunt, a talented musician, a child who lacks love, a tear bag deceived by a commission, a singer who pretends to play with a smile, and a lonely person who is constantly betrayed. I had a different feeling that the story that killed me in my childhood and finally reconciled with me was made by the director even if it was outmoded.
