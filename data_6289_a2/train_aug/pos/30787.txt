The perspective of the children is similar to that of Leonardo mentally delayed in a different sky, and it is also the death of his mother. Cit the dream of a spaceship in the name of the Leica puppy. An endless roof. The sexual illumination of bare models. PS: I love such a little magic, and my imagination is as strong as Louis Mahler's curiosity.
