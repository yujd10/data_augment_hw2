I remember a group of people in the circle at that time, and everyone said they were going to make a movie. But five or six years later, everyone split up, and only brother Zhou really made his own film. I gave Snow Mountain, his second commercial film, a five-star rating, not only because I liked the end of the film, but also because of the dream of my youth, which had been gradually forgotten by many of us. He is the only one who insists.
