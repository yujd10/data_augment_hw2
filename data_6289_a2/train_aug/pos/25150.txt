In this world of bad films and as Zhang Jiahui's first film can be said to be very big. The story is not bad, although some of the clich√©s are not clear, but the whole story is very complete and clear. As a beginning, we can see that Zhang Jiahui is trying to tell a story, and the film is not difficult to understand. The film draws many lessons from classic films, such as Exorcist and Spirit. As the first film director, it is worth being encouraged.
