The same name, the same role, different stories, I think the movie is not bad. Of course, the Bug story is not small, and the lines are a bit bad, but I just look at my face, why? Actually, I really want you Ning and Yi Han to be together, but alas, after watching Dou Miao, I became a bit of a fan of passers-by. After all, the character is very nice. Youning's character is really a little black, but it's still beautiful with blood on my face.
