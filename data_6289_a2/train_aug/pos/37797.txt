In fact, the logic of the film is a bit cowardly. It is said that Tom "talent" is certainly not because his modus operandi is impeccable- he has a great seam. It is just the plot. If you insist on saying that he is talented, I think it should be his chance, his daring and his ambition. This film makes me feel comfortable in two places. First, the plot is compact and the narrative logic is strict (not the logic of the plot), which can awaken the audience.
