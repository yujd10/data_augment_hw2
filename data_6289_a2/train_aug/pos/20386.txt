Although I love the first Spider-Man more emotionally, I have to admit that this film is the most online with Spider-Man. The bottom of the campus, rooted in the community, civilian heroes. Some anti-capitalist content is also added to the movie. Spider-Man's new spokesperson is good, he always has temperament out of poverty, and he's quite a man in the car with Lizzie's father / of course, my favorite is Iron Man! Captain America turned into Zhu Shimao / the bad guy wrote well! / need to choose the cinema carefully
