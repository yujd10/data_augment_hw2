Just watch the film, trying to describe the cruelty of war, the heavy reality, the life as light as dirt, the emotion as thin as dust, difficult no pity, no love and human relations entanglement to please the public. Julie is really arrogant, she is strong and without hesitation, saying that her beauty may not be the best praise for her, beauty is just a bottleneck for Julie, I appreciate so much a woman!
