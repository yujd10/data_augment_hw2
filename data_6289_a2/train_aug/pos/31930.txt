It's a story in which a loser continues to hit a brick wall in pursuit of art but always remains in a circle for redemption. The university will not like this kind of freshness, but the cinemaphiles will love it. The quiet and dark style of the film coupled with a loose and calm mood makes a good glass of wine. OST feels conquered in the first minutes of the film, and he was ready to cry. Perhaps the dream is like a lonely cat hit by a snowy, lame night and goes nowhere.
