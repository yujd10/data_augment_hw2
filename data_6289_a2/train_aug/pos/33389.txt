Nicole's character helps Jason, who killed his son, out of guilt as well as a self-redemption process. There are no big ups and downs in the film, even the quarrel between husband and wife or the nicole finally burst into tears in the car are handled very calmly. But it really moved me. My idea of the best feature film in the second half of the year
