I remember I was in high school when I saw him. At that time, I was really looking forward to my future. I was looking forward to loving since I was a child. Maybe that's all. I saw too much. But suddenly found a movie that I really wanted to finish. Super happy and excited Because I had originally wanted to see the little thing of "first love", but it came out by mistake that "first love is not satisfied". As it many, pure love And I still think of JJ instead of him, I think he should have such love, should have such a beautiful, shy love. It's like giving me a boost to wake up.
