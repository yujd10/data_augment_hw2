To tell you the truth, Rodriguez's style has changed and remains the same. What has changed is that popular simple narrative style, which is less impetuous, and what is constant is the expressive force of the thriller. I think the thriller in this sense is real. It comes from the fear of the public's heart, which is natural, not bulky, less terrifying, and touching. It is not Lao Luo's style that there are no colored eggs in the end, but it is good to experience the feeling of sweet sun, birds and flowers.
