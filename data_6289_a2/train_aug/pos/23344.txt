You are a slave of the past. A man's past is his glory. No, my honor is to shape the future. In fact, the gods are strong, and they have no responsibility to protect the world, just to be "interesting", and the concept of time is also different. They can do "free" entertainment for hundreds and thousands of years, and sometimes they are busy doing other things. If there is no time to respond to the reactions of human "games", there will be no miracles.
