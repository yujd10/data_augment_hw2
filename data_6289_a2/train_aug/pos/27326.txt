Unconventional characters reflect the spirit of freedom and the inevitable result of nothingness behind hippies, punk, rock and roll, etc. Youth is really a good accessory. Bertolucci uses the most perfect part of his life, which combines innocence and unrulyness, to show the ultimate space for people to pursue their own lives, and to show the meaning of life with unmodified beauty and momentary sadness.
