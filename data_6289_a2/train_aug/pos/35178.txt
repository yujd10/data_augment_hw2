The Exorcist not only refreshes the new realm of nausea and horror, but also ensures the high-end aesthetic taste, the instantaneous stimulation of the devil recedes the second place, and the heart and state of the exorcist become the real concern of the public. This is why it is different from ordinary horror films. It plays a similar role in the history of the film with the newcomer "The Silence of the Lamb", allowing the public to extend the possibility of horror films beyond the mere audiovisual stimulation.
