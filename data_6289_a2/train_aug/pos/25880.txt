I watched the story of the artist who met an assistant for two days in a row, and the two they saw yesterday wanted to flee to Barcelona. Today's artist is Antonio Banderas, regardless of the reputation of the old man Wu, his long shot and the space agenda, and even the ability to tell the story has always been a dog life that I can't stop.
