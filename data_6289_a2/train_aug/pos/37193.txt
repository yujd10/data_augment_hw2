After reading Anne's diary, I understand why I think Jinling's 13 women want to have only four stars, and the best directors are limited to expressing their emotions.The soundtrack of the camera's lines is not intended to incite tears, but shows their bones instead of expressing themselves too clearly. or prefers to limit the calm and slow arrival without chaos and the excitement of the director. "Mother" and "night and fog in Tin Shui Wai" are all very good, with a neutral and insipid account that viewers can think for themselves rather than following the mood of the director.
