The story of Keigo Higuhiro is that human nature is greater than reasoning. Kung Ping is so cute. I was experimenting with Professor Yukawa by the sea to see that part of the sea was so beautiful. Finally, I realized that I was a little stressed. Jigao's eyeliner was too thick. Uncle Fukuyama's white shirt and pants were too beautiful from start to finish. But the teacher doesn't write the formula crazyly. What does it do? Xing's face is too black.
