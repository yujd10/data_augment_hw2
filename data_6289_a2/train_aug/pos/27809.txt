The best part from beginning to end, there is no silence, whether in Russia, Dubai or India, are exciting. I especially like the thematic music of the impossible series Mission. When I think about it, I can't help feeling excited when I think about it. Finally, Tang Sao's appearance was particularly amazing, which can be a good impression left in the "Source Code". The only drawback is that the plot is too simple, but isn't it a little too demanding?
