The first film of this year that made me want to scream at God! The perfect match between Orson Wells and Kafka, from the legal trial to the judicial trial, the whole film is like a grotesque magic flower rising from the ground of the system, transmitting the fate of the madness of the small potatoes in the continuous spatial transformation. Ah, ah, ah, ah! suddenly obsessed by Perkins! I had no feeling for him when I watched Psycho.
