It is a complete and wonderful story, and the script is impeccable. The intention of the director can be seen everywhere, like the red grenade trees and the city changes. The description of the Soviet Red Army changes the positive image of camouflage that is available at the present time. Friendship and kinship, in the end, the protagonist who is spoiled and does not understand friendship has changed in an arc.
