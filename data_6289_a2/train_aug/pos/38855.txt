The fate of the characters below has always been the theme of the director Coris Markey. Impotence, impotence and even the rise against them are so weak, but friendship and brilliant love, although briefly valiant, give them the courage to live. No matter the rich or the poor, everyone has a dream, everyone has the right to lead a normal life, and no one should ignore the existence of others.
