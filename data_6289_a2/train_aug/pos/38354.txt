If there are a few literary sounds of Ledley Scott in the first film, this one is a visual masterpiece presented by Kashen. For the performance of the bases and cabins, in an age without special effects of CG, the details were extremely beautiful. Even the alien queen is no longer stinging with the camera, so the queen can kill the earthlings without a 360 degree blind angle. Douban this 7: 00 is really too much, it must be a masterpiece, Avatar can see many places to pay tribute to this film.
