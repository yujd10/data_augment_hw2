The manual says that please learn to use the transition of the "door" through this film; it turns out that the elements of the hat are actually more important for the entire film. Douban's synopsis is very stupid. Tom's actors, like Yu Wenle in my heart, should be very cool, but in fact they are very horny and not suitable for pretending. To borrow the slang that often appears in the movies, I am really tired of this kind of "high hat" movies: the director has a strong sense of existence and always acts. / "What heart?"
