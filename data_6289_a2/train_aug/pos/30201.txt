The aesthetics of the Japanese image. Firefly, Wenjiao, Sakura, the most beautiful man in the trilogy. The story of a man who is down and out as a beggar under an accident and struggles to obtain the dignity of death. It is still tender. I love such a delicate, dark and deep set of love between men and women. There is no sensual desire, but it is thicker than the blood of bones. The CP of the trilogy is admirable. Sigh.
