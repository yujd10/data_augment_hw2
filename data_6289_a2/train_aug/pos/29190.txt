The compact rhythm of the story is simple, Chinatown is a gathering place for magic sticks, and it's amazing that little monsters mingle with overturned bars and cinemas, and the final offensive and defensive battle in the department stores gives people a glimpse of the standard fighting scenes of these magical thrillers. With a mean sense of humor and slightly rough special effects, the whole film has a great sense of retro.
