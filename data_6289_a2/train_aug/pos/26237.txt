As a domestic thriller that meets the requirements of the Film Bureau- "there are no ghosts in the world", "no feudal superstition" and "hunting everywhere", it is good enough for domestic thrillers to reach this level! The explanation of the inversion of the plot is reasonable, the image is pleasant to the eye, and the sound effects are not random. I do not understand why so many people call it garbage. Is it because the Chinese people accept the shock too much and the taste is too strong?
