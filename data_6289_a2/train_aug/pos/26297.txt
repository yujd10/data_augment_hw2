In order to improve the learning opportunities and production quality of young Japanese animators, the Japanese Ministry of Culture has invested 200 million yen to carry out the Young Animator Development Program. Animation companies that can participate in the program will share 200 million yen in equal shares to produce a short animation of about 30 minutes. Finally, it has given birth to four short animated films: "La lamp kerosene de Grandpa", "le boy de cupboard", "la divination des vegetaux omnipotents" and "un coup triple".
