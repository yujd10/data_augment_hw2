Anyway, I really think you loved me without saying a word. We kissed, tightened and scratched our bare breasts in the snow, even if we didn't want to hear me sing naked erotic songs, even without King Size hotel bed. I know you love me. Of course, I finally came to the end of our "fuckin' American romance" and your love for you. By the way, thank you for knowing my favorite song.
