If you can see it at the cinema, you really need to be hypnotized; the images and soundtrack are very elegant, sharp and distinct, black and white intertwined in color (characters, complete frame), like a dream (or a sort of separation).This way, the little girl in red on Schindler's list doesn't look so beautiful; both face to face in their respective trains and then follow the tracks away, one of their favorite shots.
