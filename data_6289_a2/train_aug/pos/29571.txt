It is very nice, recommended! The magnificent landscape of the Alps is not greasy, from childhood to a great beautiful eagle, other animals, including the antelope, the fox, the earth-scratching mouse, the snowy rabbit, shot down very clearly. Especially the animals fleeing under the avalanche and the eagle hunts the great deer Milu, the scene is very shocking, which makes it seem that the survival of animals in the natural environment is really a very difficult process. In the plot, the love and hatred between the two eagles and their father and son is simple but natural. The soundtrack is very good, adjusts to the plot, adding enough emotion to the plot with few lines. At the end of the film, it was interesting to talk about the difficulty of shooting. I did not expect the eagle to be trained. Besides, Renault is still very beautiful!
