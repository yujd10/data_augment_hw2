I rarely look at science fiction, much less the game, but it gives me a good feeling. First, the rhythm is really good, the whole process will be gradually drawn, and then the team later will love one; then it is quite wonderful in terms of content. Solving puzzles in the game also involves reality, almost all foreshadowing, especially the mysterious family photo, people cannot help guessing the real identity of people behind and deeper contradictions.
