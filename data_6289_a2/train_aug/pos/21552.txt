The pride and arrogance of Montgomery have cost the allies and even the Dutch civilians dearly, but the allies have had a lot of time. And the Germans, who have done their best for the last fight, have not had time to celebrate. The so-called victory is only a flashback before they die. The stubbornness and rigidity of the British are angry. This starry drama is so serious that it is of great importance, just as the mention of Pearl Harbor thinks first of "Tiger" rather than "Pearl Harbor".
