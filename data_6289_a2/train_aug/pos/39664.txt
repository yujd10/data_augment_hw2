Can a prison cell be decorated like this? It turns out that watermelons can still be traced with lines? Is the prison super-loose? The grandmother has commuted the death penalty to a prisoner sentenced to death for so long. It seems to me that I am really rare and strange. There is a shadow of "nuns are crazy" in the harmony part. But in any case, the above comments are not enough to reduce the score of this film.
