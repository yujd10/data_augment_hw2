I first watched the remade version of Russell Crowe, then looked at the original version, I have the impression that everyone has their own wonderful. The remake is relatively more complete and exciting in the plot of the film. The original version is brief and goes directly to the point, but the details are that when the hero's son pointed a gun to the man, the man taught his son that the gun was very dangerous and should not play with it. This detail was deleted in the remake version. I think it's a better indication that the man is forced to take risks. In short, the original version and the remake version are very beautiful and beautiful films.
