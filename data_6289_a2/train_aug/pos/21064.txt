If it's really 2012, even on the college campus, losers have such strong domination. I don't know when it'll be T T if I want to see a movie with a plot to shoot directly DICK. Bad comedy is the only guy who can completely ignore Douban's score. 4.5 Half-star Channing, I really don't think it's appropriate.
