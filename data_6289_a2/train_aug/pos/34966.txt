Think of yourself as noble and cold, but in fact, the heart is empty, so you must constantly try to seduce and flirt with the opposite sex. People do not dare to stop to face white in the depths of their hearts. These people are really hateful and pathetic. Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine is very similar to his plot. By coincidence, the heroines of both films, Vivien Leigh and Kate Blanchett, won an Oscar for this film.
