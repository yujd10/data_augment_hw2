I think it's a very successful adaptation. It's just that in my impression, it's a shame to lose the first story. I remember that when I read the book, there was only the first story and the last answer. The change from the past to the present here will be a little sudden, for those who haven't read the book, I'm afraid it's a little hard to understand, but I think the publisher did his best to tell the story clearly.
