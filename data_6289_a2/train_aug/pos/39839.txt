I watched it on television many years ago, but I was deeply impressed so far. The reason for leaving an impression is not because there is something special about content or special effects, but because the atmosphere of fear created by the director is in place. Moreover, the idea that wearing yellow clothes can ensure security and a fence can separate the danger is very new, and monsters cross borders and sneak into human homes, which makes people very promising.
