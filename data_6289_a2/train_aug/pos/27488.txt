Han Han has read a lot of books, but I really haven't read this one. I didn't send it to compare it with the original. But there's still Han Han's features reflected in it, a touch of humor, not hypocrite, not to beat around the bush, a most common protagonist, very good. I may not have learned anything after reading it, but I'm going to feel the same way. It seems like the book is on, let's go back to the movie, actually, the downside of this film is that it's not like a movie, it's more similar to video and long-time microfilms.
