I have an inexpressible love for Chen Junyan's films. It's like sometimes playing something in the play, but just like sound and rhythm like the background. Love is restraint? Sometimes we lose the ability to be presumptuous, but in fact, sometimes we lose the option of being presumptuous. Where do you want to go? Where would you go? You have nowhere to go, an irreversible past pushes you forward, you are trapped in the same place, powerless to fight.
