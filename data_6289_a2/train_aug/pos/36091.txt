If the film is not directed by Chen Kaige and the actors are not such people, it will certainly get a high score of 5 stars on Douban. No matter whether the plot is too coincidental or not, it is common for young people to take pictures and surf the Internet without giving up their seats to pregnant women. Modern people are excessively bound by morality, but forget that it is a human rights society. ZF cannot free us. Why should we embarrass the same kind? Anyway, I think it's a good film.
