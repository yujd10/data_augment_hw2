Of course, the film at the time was so textured. I found that this kind of film at the time was very impressive in making the psychopath killers, and it wasn't as impressive as now, but then again, I always felt that this classic article was irrelevant and had nothing to do with Hannibal Line. In the end, the parallel lines didn't cross. Judy Foster was no different from now. Hannibal is even darker!
