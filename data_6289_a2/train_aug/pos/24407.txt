It's pretty. I don't understand why the score is so low. Too long is certainly not an advantage, but the atmosphere of suspense is very solid, the objective is beautiful, the rhythm is very good, the sound design is also very good, the story is not new, but it is very well told, I just like these films "well made". Towards the end, I thought it was another island of detention, but the plot was real. Dai Hanhan is very popular.
