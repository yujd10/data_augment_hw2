The role of Grace Kelly in the film is too pleasant, the lady full of spirit addicted to the flight, aggressive and charming in facing the hero, and shows a pitiful expression of love when we apologize. The drag race scene is particularly impressive, using the favorite movements of Xi Fat. The night green roof plays cyber punk. The "black man" at the last masquerade was so black that I thought it had become a parody movie.
