I suppose that a large number of children who used to learn something will be put in tears, even if they are women in their small circle, when they return to the great world, you are always the one who is out of place. Bao Whale said that everyone's luminous point deserves to be respected, and it may be more "approachable" than the musical awakening advocated by the film itself, so even if the completion of the film has just passed the line of passage in the same type of film, I am also ready to give a high emotional note.
