The narrative structure is rare in China, and the development of the plot also has the pleasure of declassifying. The beginning seems to be a small story, opening the model step by step, and looking at it as well as "Save my husband". Jackie Chan has the feeling of a hero in her twilight years. Liu Ye is also worthy of success. Jing Tian's share is less fruitful, and those of you who hack her to give her a star in this film that is not bad in China, is there anything wrong with her?
