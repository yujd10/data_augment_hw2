What is the origin of this ghost, who controls humans to imprison young women in order to feed on their fears? What is the reason why he likes to use keys to make holes in people's bodies? Is it just to answer the name of "five keys"? History can attract people to look down, but the frontal gimmick is too big, and the back ends carelessly, like "Martians haunt the earth." Song extinguishes the Martians, and the jet of a lamp makes the ghost go up in smoke.
