The score is not high, but I am happy to see it, and a little moved. When we are in love, we will feel that each other is very beautiful, when times change, but it turns out to be so terrible? At least not so nice at all. The person you really want to meet, who does not meet many established standards, is the one that makes you the most comfortable. How much garbage do you have to pass before you encounter true love? I have no idea. In reality, the master women tend to consider every piece of garbage they encounter as true love.
