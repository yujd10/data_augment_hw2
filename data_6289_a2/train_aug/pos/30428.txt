1. I don't understand why there are so many comments about "directly a star when I see Huang Xiaoming". Objectively speaking, the performance is pretty good. Two. At first I thought it was a Hong Kong police and bandit movie, but it turned out to be a suspensive film, and I like this kind of better movie about schizophrenia, similar to "Hypnotic Master". 3. The disadvantage is that the two lines of Fang Zhongxin and Liu Qingyun are not deep enough and could have been more wonderful. Originally four stars, to balance the score, give a five stars.
