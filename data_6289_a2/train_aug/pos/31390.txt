It's quite real. It hurts a little after reading. What unforgettable love is not an act? When angry, regardless of wanting to jump from a building and want to crash, I would like to be able to stand one another even if I was dragged away when I regret it. This kind of tearing love, once in life enough. The one with the clothes, it's funny.
