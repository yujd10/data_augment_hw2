I especially like the scene in the bath, and every character is brilliant. When I was a child, I loved the big man who rinsed Pavarotti. I thought the Chinese director was easy to fly at that time. In the last part of the big demolition of my sun, two men took pictures of the late 1990s in China with DVDs on small tricycles.
