It's a very simple story about how the weak meet the weak and how they stand out, but it's the trick to make a plot so predictable and interesting and convincing. Directors, theatre plays, photographers and actors are all of the foreground. The film has been connected from the beginning. Everything is expressed in a subtle way. Nothing is excessive. There are many heartbreaking scenes in this film. There has never been a boring moment. Each character is wonderful.
