Ha 7 is a success. Apart from 1, I don't remember which film I watched. Ha 1 was seen in Asia. When the owl sent a letter to Harry, the cinema seemed to make special effects, a gust of wind, or did I imagine? But I told people around me more than once that I don't remember much of the plot, and when I watch the eight episodes again.
