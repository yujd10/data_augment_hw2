Mike's only confession to Scott was terrible and desperate. Finally, Scott showed up with shredded clothes and looked without words at the funeral. Mike was back on the road to Idaho. He said he had tasted the road all his life. Mike's meaning to Scott is just a cloud over the Idaho he saw, experienced and finally has to leave. Humble people, humble love, really sad.
