There are very few movies about the Kuomintang, and they still tell stories about comfort women. They look very fresh, feel touching after watching them, and calm down an hour later. Hou Xiaoxian guides the edition makes the overall rhythm of the film very slow, and I love it very much. The last black and white photo is very moving. Chen Yihan Wanxi has sacrificed a lot, but it was really beautiful. Chen Jianbin is really great. Compared to Ruan Jingtian, the protagonist is Ruan Jingtian. But it is obvious that the film is about the girls represented by Wan Xi and Chen Yihan, who are the real protagonists. Although they escaped the shells, they were destroyed by the war.
