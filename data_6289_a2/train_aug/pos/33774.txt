People are forced to go out, the pleasure of earning money. Live for yourself. If you can make money, it's kung fu! terribly awesome. Market economy, the market is talking. The law of the jungle is the law of the jungle. I give up on them. It's better to socialize. This way I'm the most comfortable. I'm alone. I can pretend to be good. I did it for myself. Form this good habit. Rivers and lakes. Have fun, fight, and that's all. It's a good habit.
