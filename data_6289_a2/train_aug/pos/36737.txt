I knew that Zhang Yang's film had to tell a good story, this multi-line plot, this perfect editing ~ narrative is quite chaotic, but I like it! Cross it, back it up ~ how cool it is! Finally, all the characters make a great reversal, perfect! I love! Every character is so touching when it is shaped. The bad guys disappear, leaving only the right people to find the comfort of happiness in torture.
