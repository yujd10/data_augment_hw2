At the beginning of the great scene, the songs and dance paragraphs are amazing, the descriptions of dream / love are exquisite, and all kinds of long dazzling shots, changing lights and retro art drawings show a very different audiovisual appeal from the broken drummers. Young directors have made a leap from independence to commercial genre films. The part of the song and dance has both the salvation of the golden age and the freshness of following the rhythm of the time, exploring the evolution of jazz, the original OST is super beautiful.
