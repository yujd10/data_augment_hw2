Another work from Eastwood's Iwo Jima trilogy opposes the American perspective of Iwo Jima's letters. It was an extremely difficult naval battle, but whether it won or not was rewritten by a photo. People need heroes to place things that are too late or impossible to achieve, and the resulting heroes are forced to change the course of their lives, whether they really want it or not.
