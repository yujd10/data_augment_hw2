The Western United States in the 19th century gave people a concept of combat violence. There are always thugs who want to get something for nothing, intimidate men and women to seize wealth, cowardly people can only let it go, and avengers treat themselves with all their heart and will never be massacred! The end always belongs to the side of justice.
