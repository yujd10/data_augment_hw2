Watching a film without knowing the background of the story at all. Although it is a sporting theme, but the tone is very cold and objective. Especially the appearance of DuPont. It is very worrying. It was such a tragedy at the end. The performance of the three main actors is admirable. It is a pity that the plot is too insipid.
