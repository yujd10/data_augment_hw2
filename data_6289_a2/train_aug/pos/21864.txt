I built the moonlight at night before we split up from the park that I built for you. Every time the park lights are lit at night, I'm the one who tells the whole city that I'm thinking about you. Our separation was a misunderstanding. When I knew that you really loved me and I didn't know how to express it directly, it was too late that night.
