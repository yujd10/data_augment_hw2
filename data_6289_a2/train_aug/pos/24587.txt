Although he doesn't like Zhen Yu as a pervert (because he acted too much), he has to admit that he put this pervert to life in Shuangxiong. Looking back on Shuangxiong's plot many years later, what I can't forget is not Zheng Yijian's handsome criminal policeman, not Liming's intelligent psychiatrist, but Wu Zhenyu's pervert who can feel goose bumps when he thinks about it.
