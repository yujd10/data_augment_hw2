It's very beautiful! The story has long been familiar with the heart, but to see the confrontation between little teacher Helen and Anne is really wonderful, the play of both actors is wonderful, especially the physical performance and the control of facial expression. Teacher Anne did not treat Helen, who was deaf and blind, as a person with disabilities, but gave her the severity and punishment that normal people should have.
