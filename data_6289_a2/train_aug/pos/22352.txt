@ Spazio Oberdan Milano is always a bowie tribute, and it is strange that this biography has not become one of his well-known masterpieces. The film obviously has a high degree of completion, a good history and a first-class card, and Baoye is also very good to play at Warhol. It is better to compare with the documentary made by the radiant child. There are complementary and contrasting parts between the two.
