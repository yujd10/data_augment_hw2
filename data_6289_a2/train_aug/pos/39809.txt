Think of Jin Haixin's "stars under the sun" and "the hot sun lazily climbing in the window..." It's a very beautiful film. Thank you for meeting him at the cinema on a boring afternoon. Art may not be a good medicine, but it's also a solution. May we be nice to others all our lives and pay for our hard work.
