If one wants to become a new species, one must experience all the roles that one will no longer play. The counter-attack of the coward, which is similar to Dog Town, is a good example of the use of violence against violence, and it is also a long sculpture of "group portrait". This reference of "collective consciousness" and "awaking individual consciousness" makes the film a kind of obvious enlightening consciousness.
