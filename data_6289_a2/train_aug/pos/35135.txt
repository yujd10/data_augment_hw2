Compared to the old version, it has made a lot of intrigue extension and audiovisual wealth, to a greater extent to improve the clown/fear of the bloody and scared degree, there are many places to pay tribute to old horror movies such as Ghost Street. In essence, it is always a fantastic adventure film for children, but it just happens to have terrorist elements, so there is no need to criticize the primary plot-age for sensation. The horror film of the Youth Corps in the 1980s is supposed to be like that. Innocence and emotion are the perfect "revivance".
