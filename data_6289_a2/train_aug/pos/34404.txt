4 stars + 1. 11 years old, 22 films. Since the Universe Marvel, which was put in place when the phrase "I am Iron Man" was born in 2008, all memories have been integrated in the three hours of "couplet 4". The way to deploy the plot of the film can be vaguely guessed after watching "couplet 3". Indeed, there is no other way to revive them. But even if it is a new pot of old wine, "Fu Lian 4" is still a work full of pleasure and sentimental, not stiff and sentimental. Like a series of "emotional rolling basements" that has been connected with Marvel for 11 years, objectively speaking, "couplet 4" is not perfect, but it still brings out the pre-envelised luggage in all previous works. This is my personal opinion of the Universe Marvel until now the best.
