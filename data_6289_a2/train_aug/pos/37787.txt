Some people like to compare it to "Avatar". I have little knowledge of what is too technical, but it is visually equal, and more importantly, the story of "Pi" is perfect. We look forward to more such films, so that we will not gradually lose confidence in the movies in the bad movies all day. Four and a half stars.
