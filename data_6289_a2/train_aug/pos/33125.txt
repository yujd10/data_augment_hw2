The end of life and death was covered by the sound of the trumpet, until the film finished the last row of subtitles, I was still looking forward to the secondary words of "many years later". I hope Fan Honggen was not dead. Perhaps in my opinion, he did not deserve to die. His resentment and psychological imbalance erupted irrationally under the action of alcohol, but would it be too cruel to end his life with one of these three shots?
