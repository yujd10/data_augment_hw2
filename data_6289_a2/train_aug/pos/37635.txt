Some films are like poetry, you ask the poem to be concise and logically clear to tell a story, hard. The clip of the reading of the letter is really moving, the words are as sweet as a broken kiss, and the expression of lust is appropriate. The sexual scene of octopus and kelp can be considered as a slightly humorous metaphor, and sex can be like playing a game. A very exquisite and pleasant film. Ps: personal understanding 1. The octopus and kelp refer to the sea, and the sea and the horse are very important images in the film, symbolizing freedom, tolerance and breaking chains. 2. Octopus, kelp, long hair, woman, winding.
