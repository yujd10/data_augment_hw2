The people of Douban are really pretending to be pushed. No matter what the film is, they all complain that there is no result, reprimanding the actors and the directors for having scolded the director and wanting to get a negative note at the end of the plot. Does it make them cold and artistic? The film is nothing else, at least visually pleasing.
