It's like you couldn't see the whole world through the camera. I can say I love you so easily under the dark curtain. Until the end of the world. But out of a small grid, we're stuck in the situation where our lovers aren't satisfied. In the end, I was the only one who left. Turn into a rainbow in your tears forever. OST is awesome. So I gave the fifth star.
