It's a movie that immediately after I saw it, it was like screaming to tell the world that it was so good! The love line between Andy Lau and Meng Jiahui is perfect! How to draw a romantic emotion really delicate ah! I can't believe that a generation after 1995 falls in love with Andy Lau! What a show for life! All kinds of unexpected inversions in the plot! Ah, I love Johnnie so much!
