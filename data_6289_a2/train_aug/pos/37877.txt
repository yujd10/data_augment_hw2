Young AlPacino looks a little like Alex, the main singer of Arctic Monkey, plus every time sonny comes out in the movie, the crowd applauds with force. He really looks like a rock star! It's a lot of fun, although it's a crime movie, but it's very easy, rookie thieves and hostages become basically one! Outside of AlPacino, the crowd in the street is the cutest!
