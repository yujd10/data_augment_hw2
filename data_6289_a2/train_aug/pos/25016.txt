What really decided to give four stars was the end of a conversation between the two on the balcony that seemed to be on two channels, that is, faced with love and even detached from the label of love, I can think of the most in line with the human state of mind. a complexity that can be shown. It will be reread, whether bad or good, once not enough to form all my judgment, from this point of view, it is at least very interesting.
