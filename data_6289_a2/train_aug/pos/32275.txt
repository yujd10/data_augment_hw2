I didn't think it was BE, but because of this, thinking about human nature deepens the depth of how children think about life and death. What kind of love is in the eyes of children? Sometimes it looks like a small adult, sometimes it looks like an innocent child. She says that what she thinks about heaven is what she misses. Finally, she reads the song she wrote. The poem fully interprets children's ideas about life and death.
