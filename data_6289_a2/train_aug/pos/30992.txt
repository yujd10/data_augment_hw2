Watch the short film first and then the feature film, the scale and the kiss are a little bigger than the short film, the story feels a little more bloody, but always sweet I can't help but show the old aunt-like giggle. Gabriel is really beautiful! Curly hair ~ deformed eyelashes ~ white skin and beautiful ha! He and Leo are both superb on the side! Giouana is also a little girl super cute! The director asks you to make the third film! Want to see two protagonists in a great meat lounge.
