The story, the mood, the rhythm, the atmosphere, the image, the mind, the performance, the dialogue, the gimmick, the artifacts, the black, the opportunity, the programming, the perfect film! The film has a ferocious and undisciplined sense of primitive guilt, the fear is the fear itself, more than many deliberate suspensive films.
