The second Indian film, once again seen the wonderful performance of Uncle Mei, the film continues the style of the Indian film: song and implantation of dance + appropriate life. Although at the beginning the arrival of the aliens makes it seem that it will be a science fiction movie to the old, but then it is completely unexpected, first of all, the double-line cut begins to depict the scene of life of the heroine (this plot is well described in the Indian song and dance style!)
