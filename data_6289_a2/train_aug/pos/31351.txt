The story is complete and the animation details are perfect. The only problem is that much of the story is similar to the discovery of Nemo. In comparison, I think Cat and Peach Blossom Garden is better than finding Nemo. However, the obvious stories are the same. The same role setting makes "Cat and Peach Blossom Garden" to a disadvantage! After watching many bad reviews of this film, most of them think that the boss who pursues the light must be a part-time choreographer and director, spend money and waste resources, but as animation films are very difficult to do, why not support such a beautiful film in China? The main problem of the whole film is the plagiarism of the plot. The animation itself is very good.
