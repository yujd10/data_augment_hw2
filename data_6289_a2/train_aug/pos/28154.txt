The film is very quiet, no incentive, no impulse. When the director takes care of it in everyday life, he can let the audience infiltrate and slowly empathize with the characters. Cher's first film is really high, and the two crying scenes and Aunt Mei are better. Aunt May in the poster looks like Sophie Marceau.
