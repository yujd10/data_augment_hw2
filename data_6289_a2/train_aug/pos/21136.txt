Zhang Yibai's film in Chongqing shows the obvious features of life in Chongqing, including the Yangtze River, hot pot, small noodles, 18 scales, different exchanges and magical light rail. The breath of life is rich, the dialogue is very literary and artistic, the image is fundamentally hot, genre. The interlude is better than the theme.
