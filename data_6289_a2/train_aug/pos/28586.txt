The United States is ready to face history, and the director is wise to choose such a theme with extra points. This film makes us feel once again the inhuman living conditions of the blacks oppressed because of the race. Twelve years is torture for this free man, but he is still working hard and full of hope, and it is even harder to describe those blacks who have been slaves to life. We expect that there will be such a film in China, not for construction and advertising.
