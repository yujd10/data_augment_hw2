I wanted to see the film many years ago, but I didn't have good resources. Today, I finally finished watching HD. The actors' talents of the three actors can rise to grow, and there is enough suspense on the setting to change the will by implanting a chip in the soldier's brain, and the plot in which the protagonist peels the cocoon layer by layer to reveal the truth. The overall score of four is a good drama of suspense.
