After watching her for a few minutes, I didn't want to watch her anymore, but I didn't expect me to finally fall in love with this big cat, and the scene that rhinoceros came back was unexpectedly moved. Don't scold the movie is stupid, not all movies need to have depth, this kind of film is very warm to see as good......
