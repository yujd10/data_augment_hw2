With regard to defects, one can hardly say that one is that there appear to be too many elements of the genre film, and the other is that the characters of the film are too close to the perfect. It is difficult to imagine that it is a comedy with a realistic theme, and it is difficult to pay attention to the background represented in this film from a realistic perspective, because it is a fairy tale set up in the real world.
