If it's Hitchcock, I'm a little disappointed. If it's a suspensive film, my understanding is a little limited. If it's done in a play, the effect should be better. Grace Kelly exists as a goddess. Detests the hero, he is dominant, strong and boring. As for the end, I still don't know if the seller is a murderer! The goal of movement is too dizzying.
