What do you mean by growing up? The smile has begun to converge, the chin has grown a beard, the height has become very great, no longer wanting to think. It does not grow, it grows old. Growing up is when you watch a movie ten years later and think of something old and understand something new. And when the film ends, it will always be as tearing as it was ten years ago.
