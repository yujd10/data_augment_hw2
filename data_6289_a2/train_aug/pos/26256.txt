It is too rare to see such thematic works, the sex of older people, feeling that people are old, talking about sex has become taboo, especially in a relatively conservative environment. Let's not talk about it, it doesn't mean that there are no, the film reflects a lot of social problems, the sex of older people, euthanasia, elderly people alone, prostitutes, transgender people, young people with disabilities... Use a very light narrative technique to express very heavy social problems.
