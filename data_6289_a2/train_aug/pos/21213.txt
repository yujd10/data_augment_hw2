BMY, I haven't really been touched by a movie for a long time. The first half of the storytelling and flashback narration are actually a bit messy and cowardly. The second half of the paragraph describing the mother's change of attitude towards her boyfriend is very delicate, but it's still a little slow compared to the short game after waking up. Everything else is very good. This end is actually an oriental compromise, and it's not necessary to say clearly that there's always a process, and it's not easy for two souls who are so similar to come together. In fact, the boys' feelings are like this, ah, at the right times, they can do everything they want with each other, when they're light, they can even not want to say a word, everything is hidden in their hearts, and they'll be born after a long time. At this point, it's necessary to rebuild the bridge between feelings and trust, and one side can be saved by taking the initiative.
