The name of the film has nothing to do with the first film, or even the film could have another name, and it would be better to launch another independent biography of the criminal, so that the film can be independent and free from the channels of the series. Films with the same subject will inevitably be used for comparison, but in fact there is no connection between the two films. When fans buy tickets to enter the cinema, they will be very disappointed when they find that the content is out of reach with each other. Therefore, it is normal to have a weak subjective note. However, objectively speaking, this film is a particularly well-maintained police and bandit film, Wang Jing is really perfect, and the story is smooth and complete. In terms of actors, it is played by many former actors, both the inner formation of the characters and the tension of performance are very substantial and powerful.
