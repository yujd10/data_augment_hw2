Chef d'oeuvre by Jane Campion, 1993 Cannes Palme d'Or. 1 film entirely feminist, female psychology is exquisite and elegant; 2 Holly Hunt's double shadow after the well deserved appearance, resolved, arrogant, delicate under the heart full of lust; 3 beauty of photography, blue sea, grey sky, wet jungle, sea and beach-high piano notes of hippocampus; 4 poetic and metaphorical composition and programming: aerial plans, close-ups, above shoulder, double, peep.
