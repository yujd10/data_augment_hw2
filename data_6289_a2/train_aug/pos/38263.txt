Uncle JD is very good. There are some places where people laugh so much that they have a point on the side! XD narrative scene description powerful in place, the characters are resembling. The charm of paper moved to the wonderful humor on the screen. The Roman image in the film is humorous and romantic! The color of photography is beautiful, the language of rhythm is joyful. JD interprets the characters in a different way! It is one of the JD films that surprised me in recent years. If the production continues at this level, it can be pursued. Forget the pirate series. =
