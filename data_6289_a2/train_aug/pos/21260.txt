The rhythm always seeks a balance between horror and humor. (the first half) the omniscient perspective knows that water pollution is the culprit, and it is more likely to serve the endless cycle of the end, which is not very useful to the plot. One can say that the plague is without cause, and the reason for "no cause" is taken up by men who do not know where to infect, girls who bite people and haunted dogs. Several applications that overlap are very essential, and the composition of the lens has made a small breakthrough in the creative program of horror films. For example, I like the plan of elevation of this child. Let me think of "nourishing in the forest", all of them escape the forest in nature, although "nourishing in the forest" is strange and chaotic, there is in fact only one protagonist in the confrontation, a mysterious organization (I can't remember). In this film, in addition to the greatest pollution of the police, there is also a resistance to the resistance of the water, there is also a resistance to the small one.
