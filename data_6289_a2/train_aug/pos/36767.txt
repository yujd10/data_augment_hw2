Read the Cantonese version, although the dubbing is a little strange, but several places are really hilarious, at the same time there are moving tears. Fiona is really too beautiful and too young. Tsai Tsai feels that he broke through himself. Zheng Zhongji is naturally funny. Haha. It is said that the song on the theme is really sweet, and I "happened" to hear the rap of Fang Datong, which is also another kind of perfection of khafi.
