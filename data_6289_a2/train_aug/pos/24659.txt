Renyi + Mandarin's team, frankly, moved everyone's acting skills to the big screen, and it was very nice. As Bing's mentally handicapped lover, I'm a little sorry because his role is too straight, but Professor Han Tongsheng broke out again. As soon as he opened his mouth, I wanted to get on my knees. It's a shame that Mi Tiezeng is a little out of the norm and is making too much effort. Anyway, it's worth seeing!
