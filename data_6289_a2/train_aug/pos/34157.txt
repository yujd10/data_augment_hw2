I love so much that I have a different impression of Toshihiro Yamashita. The ingenious interaction and clear atmosphere of the actors are very rich through the multi-level design. Every interior smile is considered to be stuck after the rehearsal, not responsible for the performance of the natural state, but to highlight the pure creativity of the director extracted from the girl's daily life. These narrow-angle booking lenses that surround the long lens all risk the charm of looking at their own creation.
