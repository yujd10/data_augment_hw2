The story is concise and round, and several commonly used elements are scattered, which makes the film rather pleasant, the quality of the music is still good, and sometimes by humorous or sarcastic inadvertence. In the film, apparently impersonal people are full of warmth, and the sullen guys are very hot inside, looking at the issue of immigration in a different state of mind. Aki in his sixties has some ideas, and he is charming and beautiful. Watching the film will remind the people of another Aki Le Havre.
