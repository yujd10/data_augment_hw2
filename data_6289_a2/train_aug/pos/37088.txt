On August 1, 2014, it's not a tragedy of a mid-life crisis, it's a tragedy of self-realizing failure, and when it hits a brick wall in the outside world, the people closest to you become a trash can of negative emotions.

Marriage should not be a refuge, nor an escape from life, nor a move to Paris.
