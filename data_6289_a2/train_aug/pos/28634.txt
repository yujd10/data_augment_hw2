Watching this film is like watching an age gone. The Soviet Union in 1974 was the most brilliant Soviet Union, and it was also the Soviet Union approaching its decline. This film is like a landscape film that takes me around the Soviet Union. The heroine is very beautiful and has a slight exhibition. Some places are still very funny.
