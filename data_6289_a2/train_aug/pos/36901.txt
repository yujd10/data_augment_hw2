"I wish we could be like you and mom." the story of taking her daughter to the amusement park on a rainy day, the mother looking for her father's bed with her head down, the plane coming to take you late in the rain during the working day, waving in the air between the two grandchildren in the video, wearing a birthday hat in the room. They are both warm and tearing moments. "They call Alzheimer is a long farewell. They gradually lose their memories and leave little by little." As long as he wants to live, live happy. After 7 years of farewell, rejoice in bitterness, the bitterness of life changes in the happiness of the family. "Whatever my sorrow, I can't beat his family."
