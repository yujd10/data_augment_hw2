In the dream, there are cans of cola transformed into penguins, huge mysterious creatures, unsweetened coffee, incredible events waiting to be explored, and mysterious big sisters with soft breasts. In the end, I think of the young girl who travels in time and space, eager to meet again one day, although this dream can be forgotten when I grow up, and I may not forget it. This kind of trust that I will not forget is probably the most beautiful part of teens.
