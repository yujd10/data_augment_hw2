What a beautiful cult film. Every dirt in the summer night in the sunny nature is clear and beautiful, wild flowers in the valley, the white Nordic fabric, everyone with a simple smile on their faces, the evil plasma that is so sweet and so sweet to drink together and to become crazy. (overexposure has a wonderful effect on the bizarre rendering of the distortion of the supernatural as a dream.
