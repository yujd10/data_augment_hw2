I'm sometimes a little paranoid about the kind of love film I've been through all my life. I also believe that they're going to live a unique trust and live a peaceful life with their tacit understanding, so that they can count on each other when they age. But who would have thought that senile dementia would be so fooled by the fate that there was more of this game in old age, but it was no longer a life of loyalty that could easily say everything. Don't cheat as much as possible, don't give up that person, that's the basic definition.
