Ten years ago, the title was Yossi & Jagger. Ten years later, the title was Yossi. The title of the film translated at the time certainly didn't expect to make the second film, but when the second film was released, the free translation title seemed superfluous. I watched one or two films together, and I always thought it was only this way that I could be considered a complete film.
