I was happy to see this film when I was young. At that time, I was confused. I thought that the end of the story was that the little boy really saw his mother. Now that he grew up, he realized that the boy was starving to death, and the reality was ruthless. But there are still many beautiful moments in the film, like the boy rubbing the floor while leaving a small foot, building a stone tower near the river and praying for a chain of prints around the tower in the courtyard on a snowy night. The temple seen by a 5-year-old in the film was deeply printed on my mind, which managed to cross with the memory of my 14-year-old child living in the nunnery on the mountain. I was watching the nunnery with the eyes of a child, and when I was watching another delarbunk temple on the top of the hill, I recalled the scene in which the little boy worshipped on the mountain and waited for his master to come back.
