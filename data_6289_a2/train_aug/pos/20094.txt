From primitive society to agricultural society and then to capitalist society, Huang Bo put a theory of social evolution on the big screen. However, on the whole, he holds a rather nihilistic attitude: it is not reliable for capitalists to be in power, and no more than people at the bottom. Well, it can no longer be extended. Although Huang Bo finally chose to believe in the truth, goodness and beauty of human nature, this part is sufficient to make this film one of the most discussed Chinese films in 2018.
