The violent version of Shawshank's Redemption, but Shawn Van Damme is solely responsible for the violence and completion of the redemption, the redemption process is promoted by the black cell companion and the dead cell companion Billy. It is a good prison film, but there is still a gap with Shawshank's Redemption.
