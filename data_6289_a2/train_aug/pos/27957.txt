I feel that Andy Lau's subtraction line is not enough, and some of the plots obviously appeal to the public, but Sister Tao is very restrained on the other side, and some scenes are very good. But Andy Lau has done very well this time, very restrained. Yu Liwei's image is a little uncomfortable, and part of the composition is very strange. I have to look at it again to see if it's an illusion.
