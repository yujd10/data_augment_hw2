I don't understand at all. The story is basically 2 stars. However, anyone who can mark rationally after watching this film is also impressed. I am a mentally retarded lick face coaxed by this kind of pure fans. I can only score 5 stars without brains! In the end, the fireworks show of the Tour de Paris cost too much money, and the Wolfgang party contributed to the warmest part of the show!
