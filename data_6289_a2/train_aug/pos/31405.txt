People who are used to watching fast-paced movies don't recommend it to the movie. Four star music images as well as the rough plot, watch the stereotype, but respect the original work for the first time. I can't understand who came back to admire the director for the second time. The deeper sense of the story is that you can't calm down and feel it. What people don't understand is that there's another star that maliciously marks those who don't watch a movie.
