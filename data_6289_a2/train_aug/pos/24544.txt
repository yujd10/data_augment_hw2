The first two hours are more like the use of virtual biographies as a starting point to show the Hollywood era, with prosperity and decline, and the complementary hardware and software of the two protagonists (greater than the brothers and smaller than the husband and wife). (The figure of Peter is still full) but for the ignorant public without background, like me, it is true that the county is a little slow and fragmentary, but of course, Quentin's violent aesthetic has finally exploded in the last 30 minutes at five times the speed, and the feeling has gone away.
