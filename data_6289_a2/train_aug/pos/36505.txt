True to the original, the successful adaptation ~ 150 minutes covers the story with a duration of 20 years as long as possible. Of course, some auxiliary clues have been reduced or modified due to space limitation. I have read the original work three times. I am too familiar with all the details of Dongye's long novel to resist a careful adaptation. However, if only there had been more interaction between Sakuho adult and Lionshi, the emotional line was so weak that the tragedy of Liangshi seemed abrupt.
