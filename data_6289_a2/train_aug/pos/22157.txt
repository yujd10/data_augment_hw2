The 3D experience is good, the decadent beauty of the male is very beautiful, from time to time there is a small fixed view of plum, the female interpretation skills are relatively weak, without expression from beginning to end. What is more amazing is the transformation dance of Rihanna, which is entirely tailored for her! The visual effect of the whole film is perfect, the scene is imaginative, and the change between real and virtual world is beyond imagination!
