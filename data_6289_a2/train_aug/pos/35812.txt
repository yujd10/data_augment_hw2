This film is very good. It is divided into three sections. First, the American army attacks superficial positions. Second, tunnel operations. Three, fight back. The proportion of the third part is very low, and the second part is the main body. This part was very well managed, showing both the difficulties of the war and the spirit of revolutionary optimism.
