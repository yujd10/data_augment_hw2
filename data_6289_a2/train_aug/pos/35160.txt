A musical that really enters the hole. Love version 00! After reading the 12th edition, I just think it's good. I feel that my face is without expression and my expectation is not high. As a result... I played version 00 a few months later. Oh, my God! This edition is too emotional, the performance is too delicate and moving.. I feel overburdened sensual throughout the process. Probably pomped my point rotten, ha. Full of affection, super love
