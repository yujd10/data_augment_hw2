Every time I open this film, I feel that the description of childhood is too bloody to watch. I realized that I was old enough to calmly face the cruel youth. After watching the edited version of the director, I almost burst into tears. If I was the hero, I would do the same. My child bring peace and happiness to my two beloved women and my former friends. No matter what you choose at the crossroads of life, you will regret it.
