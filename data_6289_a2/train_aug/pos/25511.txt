This kind of quick crime movie seems pretty interesting, but there are many loopholes, for example, a police woman who seems to be a recruit asks Mary if Mary has been walking with a male pig recently. Mary denied, while Mary was sitting next to the romantic rival of the male pig, Oscar, the policeman, but another question would have been the truth.
