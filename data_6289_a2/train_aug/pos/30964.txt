After seven years of bad movies, Zhang Yimou finally came back on the right track. Takata's role is tailor-made for Takakura Ken, and the charm of this patient and delicate Eastern man is so convincing. What's amazing is that everyone involved in the performance, be it the child, the translator or the head of the village, can be so natural in front of the camera.
