I can't move a finger. You don't know how many times... Suddenly... I guess my hands and fingers start to move, and then I get out of my wheelchair and start running. I can touch flowers, feel velvety or touch a beautiful woman like you. We should love each other more, Valerie, and make good use of our lives.
