When Chengmin went through 16 years alone and returned to the normal world, he found that no one believed he was Chengmin, and he had no room to live. Fear, fragility and sadness mixed with Chengmin. Jiang Dongyuan's tear-like eyes are too hurt to hide his face. I love the story. I think it's better than "your name". The idea and idea of a special fixed time is super beautiful, and the tone of the great perspective is also too beautiful.
