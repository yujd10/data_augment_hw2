The filming is in order, everything depends on the legend of the story! I used to write a lot of anecdotes about J. Paul Getty in the energy-rich series, so the film didn't surprise me. This family is particularly powerful. Although Paul Getty's company, the richest man in the world, disintegrated, he left a huge Getty Art Center in the world. His son Gordon Getty made his name in the history of art as a composer, his grandson Mark Getty founded the famous Getty Images and served as administrator of the British National Gallery, and his granddaughter Ariadne Getty also directed works like 127 hours I saw, but it's a shame that the kidnapping ruined the life of my grandson Paul Jr. The great-grandchildren are not ordinary people. Andrew Getty invests and makes films at the same time.
