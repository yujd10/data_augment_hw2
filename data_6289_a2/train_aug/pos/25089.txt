A rare road film for the means of transport. Slow rhythm, it is the calm mentality and the wisdom of the elderly to enjoy the landscape along the way-- vast sky, endless fields, clear sky, thunder and lightning, rich depth of field and long lens, beautiful landscape, good OST, hot slices of chicken soup ~
