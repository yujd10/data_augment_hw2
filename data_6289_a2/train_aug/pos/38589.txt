As a theatrical version of the trilogy, I feel that Wurang Taniguchi does not use the routine of the final episode, but disperses and reassembles the whole story, so that it feels that there are not many pictures in the TV version, most of which are new. Although some plots have just been skipped, they are still understood as a limitation of the length of the film.
