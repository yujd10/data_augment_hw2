"In the future, there will be no problem in the future." I was very honoured to participate in the exchange of the producer "Fujita", from which I also learned the opportunity and the process of making this film. Music and television often appear in the film, and this one is even more closely related to him. I especially like the last part of the film. Overall, the story is funny, funny, warm and beautiful. In terms of dubbing, Hoshino and Blackwood match well, but when I was a child, I was a bit in disagreement.
