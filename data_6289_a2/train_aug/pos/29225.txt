Feng Xiaogang's comedy, which is different from Party An and Party B if you're the only one, is different from Party An and Party B's New Year's comedy. It's more real, more real, more lonely, boring, sad, and portrays the feeling of sending lovers abroad twice. It really restores the wave of going abroad in the early 1990s, a social phenomenon that proves that you can never go to another place or a foreign country.
