After reading a few comments, they say it's black history. I think the bloody battle in the Xiangjiang River is not black history. Personally, I think the AB regiment and various counter-revolutionaries are counted. I think the theme of the film is that the wrong command of strategic ideology will inevitably lead to the defeat of the war (converging with the second and sixth). The addition of scenarios such as fidelity to the faith and the lack of fear of sacrifice highlights the revolutionary spirit of the Red Army and the struggle of the leaders (Mao Zedong's repeated exhortations were rejected, stressing his impotence in the face of reality).
