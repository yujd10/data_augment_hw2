The first film of the new year has a strong sense of preaching, and there is no logic in the plot, but now I see the long brother movie, nothing else, just for fun. I really feel that there are nearly 60 people. It's not easy to be a devoted actor (except that I'm an old hard one.) you still have to give four stars.
