Joaquin is incredible. On the screen, he is himself a joker. There are not only several scenes that honour the appearance of Niro's "Taxi driver", but also the surprise of the film "The Joker" created for DC after Nolan's "Black Knight". Perhaps because the director and the writer want to explain too many causes and consequences in the film, they are related to the composition proposed. Unfortunately, he did not exceed the expectations to reach a pattern and depth comparable to the classics.
