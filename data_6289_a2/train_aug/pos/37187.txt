When I came to Douban, I found that I had already scored and wanted to see it, but I was suffering from the lack of resources. The name of this film is really second. At first I thought it meant male lead, but after reading it, I think it refers to Cameron in a narrow sense and the boys (including a small number of girls) who are sent to conversation therapy in a broad sense. At first I thought there would be a lot of violence (it could have been cut because it was published), but it wasn't, but there was no reduction in heart tearing and anger, which was washed the brain. And Victor himself is gay, why do you want to do this to other boys? You have to accept and love each other first. Let the world be nicer and more equal.
