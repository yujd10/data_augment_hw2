The polyphonic sonata of wisdom, the history of the immortal struggle for power. The narrative structure is clear and three-dimensional, and the details are miraculously linked. Jealousy is the driving force of evil, desire is the root of sin, civilization is the limit of limitation, pursuit is the right of self, love is the resistance of good will, and morality is the hypocrisy of evil.
