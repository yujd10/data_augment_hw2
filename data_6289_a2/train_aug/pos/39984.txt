The history of the world seems to be 320 minutes apart, and the film ends as if it had been the end of a life. Bergman used this work to review his writing career and incorporate decades of thought about marriage and religion into the script. The feelings were sincere and full. Although Henry and Anna broke the barriers between classes and came together, they found that there was something that could never be broken, that is, in terms of character, both sides were strong, coupled with suspicion, enough to put an end to the marriage. The light and color carefully modulated by the director make each frame have the texture of oil painting, which can be called the higher work of art.
