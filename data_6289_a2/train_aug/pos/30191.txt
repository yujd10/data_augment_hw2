In fact, I was looking for a documentary about Napoleon. As a result, the film was made. The first half of the film is set for a long time. The rhythm is slow. And a bit boring. But when Napoleon did the BE dance on the stage. I was surprised. Is it the mediocre Napoleon? Except for Napoleon whose name has no luminous point. There are always people around us. It was ordinary for a long time. But there was a flash at some point. Litt up.
