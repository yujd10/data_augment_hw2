After the evening class, I rushed home to watch this film because it was raining today. The conservative and humble girl, who can't read but can read pictures, is sometimes full of emotion and sadness for her master's painting. She can see colors other than white in the clouds but can't see a happy future with her master-art born in painful love is the most touching. This part of the mouth, it's so beautiful!
