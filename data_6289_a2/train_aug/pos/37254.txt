I love these amazing movies. I also like the phrase in a movie review, "Life and death is really a bit super Mary-life is: unhappy, walking, taking gold coins, not on monsters." Death is: drilling pipes, all grey, continue walking, taking gold coins, not on monsters. Ohh! The miracle of the resurrection has arrived! It's: drilling out, dawn, but also walking, taking gold coins, not on monsters...... It makes sense!
