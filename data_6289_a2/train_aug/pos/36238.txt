I just saw the title and thought it was the Japanese Mary Su style that hurt eggs again. I watched Douban's introduction and I was a little interested in taking a look at it. After watching it, I'm glad I didn't miss such a good movie. There aren't many great movies with style, comedy, appearance, ideas and power.
