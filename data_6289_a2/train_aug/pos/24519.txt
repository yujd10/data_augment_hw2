It's really bloody and heavy! But it's so deep! Like a film made 30 years ago, its disgusting and real scenes still tremble or even look straight into the eyes, and the special effects and makeup are too powerful! The hypothesis that monsters can imitate humans also shows suspicion and ruthless killing between people. It's really a big horror movie! The open ending has a aftertaste. It's a shame that the structure is a little late and dull.
