This is not the best movie of Takeshi Kitano, but it is also a good show. It is the story of the Japanese black man who fled to the United States, there is no doubt that there is the playability, coldness and violence of this old man, as well as the joy, the sensation that works every time, and the true temperament of being an interpreter and actor in the works.
