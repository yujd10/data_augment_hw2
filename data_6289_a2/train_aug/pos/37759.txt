The cold aspect of Takeshi Kitano is soft enough to kill people. Hisashi's music is really amazing. A film plus his music has to be upgraded to a higher level immediately. These long and dark scenes in the film seem very soft under his music. I like the facial expressions and flower paintings of Takeshi Kitano better.
