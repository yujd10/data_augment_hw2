In the film, the two brothers are not afraid of the adventure in the face of change, insist on the struggle side by side, and the spirit of never leaving and never abandoning has moved me. Shencha has a sense of justice and is tolerant of the brothers. On the contrary, Yu Ba does not have the self-culture of the god of the door, but I always hope that the domestic animation can mount another great building in the future.
