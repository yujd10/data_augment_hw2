History of the Chinese film: The film consists of two fundamentally unrelated stories. The relationship between the two stories, like Takeshi Kaneshiro and Faye Wong, approaches infinitely and has no chance to cross, just 0.01 centimetre away. The film contrasts with the tragic Baroque giant "Early and Western Evil" in various aspects. In short, the style of Wong Kar-wai and Kefeng is typical "Kaleidoscope, MTV, post-modernism".
