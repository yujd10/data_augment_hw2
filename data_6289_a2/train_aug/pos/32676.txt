From the first shoot of the film, I thought it was Kieslowski's film, because its objective was always concise and instructive. If you don't watch it carefully or listen carefully, you miss everything. Although it's already so famous, it forgot to check the basic information by looking at it. I may be the only one to understand the film, it's the story of the old judge's life, there's no Valentine and Auguste, it's just a private story.
