I've been the director for several years and I just finished reading the novel not long ago. Although the originality is so high that it doesn't seem necessary to give the name of the original work, the choreographer and the director are really successful this time. The multi-perspective and multi-timeline is a bit like a longer version of "lurking". The sixth episode is composed of several groups of more than ten people with ten minutes of shots, being cool. I've never seen a haunted house attack the heart to such an extent, how can everyone be ordinary people? The fifth episode of the little sister is so pitiful that the consequences of natural and man-made disasters are still so good. Boing, I didn't expect the truth of the red door in the last episode.
