The world seen in the film is like a shepherd's dog (police) protecting lambs (citizens) from wolves (criminals). Or they mount their own image of the chief of police: it is both traditional and human, hoping that it will be something that will last forever, but it will also make my face recognize. The last picture plan that was submitted to them was naive.
