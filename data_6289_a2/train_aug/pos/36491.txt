Romantic fairy tales, sweet, sad and defenseless. The presentation of love is specific and delicate: attraction, lust (opera stands, faces flowing on the dance floor), gift, inferiority, pain. Less edition; the transformation of time and space with ruins as clues. The camera expresses the psychological proximity far and close. There are always people in the environment who steal even the host (section ballroom).
