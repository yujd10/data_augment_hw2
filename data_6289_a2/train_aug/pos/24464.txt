It's so hard. It took me many days to finish it. Bad love makes beauty ugly. It's the first time you've discovered that a tyrannical businessman can have a negative impact in this way. He always has Yingying and Yanyan. His halo of talent makes people prejudge and ignore your talent. Your enthusiasm and dedication to sculpture are ridiculous fishing news in the eyes of others. It's so sad.
