It is a charming film. Beautiful humfrey, naughty and nice boy. Although the plot is simple and full of Hollywood flavor, the emotional part is still quite moving. CC: a short story interprets a great wisdom. It is a rare good film that touches the deepest and weakest part of a person's heart. Simple as a water pool, deep, pure, sweet.
