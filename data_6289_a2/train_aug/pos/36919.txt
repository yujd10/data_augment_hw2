When I saw Qingzhou not long ago, I thought that the pearl left behind me, and I thought with brilliance that the temperament of the film was very fit for me, and I continued to think of the director. In the last few days, it suddenly sprang up, and it took a week to pass through all the works of Zhang Lv that can be found, and this judgment is more accurate. This article on Geese is quite like a sequel to Qingzhou. Zhang Lu's film is probably characterized by a story of a feeling of different perspectives. I quite like this style, but I can't get tired anyway (Old Master and Lu Ban flashed through my mind, laughing). Thanks to the Internet and Mr. Zhang Lu, it's a shame that the floor of the domestic film is not yet suitable for that kind of person.
