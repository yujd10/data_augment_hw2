A good film of the fighting nation that is very appreciative. For: As much as the battle scenes in Hollywood, the Russian pure men make people excited. Bazookas and tanks fight in their turn, and the fierce sense of substitution in the street war is extremely strong. In the full version, the beautiful border landscape before the war and the people on the bus are very loving. The disadvantage is that the little boy's dreams sometimes put people into play.
