It is quite difficult to change the original work into a film, and it is already very good. What is missing is the heart of the character behind the image, but the psychological struggle of the Swede is all the representation of his death, so the film has lost part of his central soul. But the image adds more details, making the text more complete than before, together, very invincible. In Merry's ultimate conversation with the Swedes, I had never felt so much that life was meaningless.
