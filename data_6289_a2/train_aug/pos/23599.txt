He will suffer without love, but he will die without camouflage. I think it is the climax of the art of acting Matt Damon. Ripley in the film is selfish, vain and cruel, while shy and shy to pay for the pleasure of his lover. Murder is a terrible crime, but every time he shows up, one cannot help pinching a cold sweat when the situation is in danger. Several desperate times can only make people feel sorry and ruthless when they have no choice but to kill them, and it is embarrassing to see that cancer has been committed several times. Emotional transmission, nice exact interpretation of this complex role, always let me feel like falling into the ice. Although cute, after looking at Ripley's original candidate, I can't help but wonder what will happen to Norton like Ripley.
