Originally, I saw the 2010 edition a long time ago, but I really forgot who the killer was. I didn't think about it when I watched the movie today. I kept guessing until the last day. The two girls who came to see him talked with joy that the film was played by Depp before the opening, and then when Depp came out after the opening, they wondered who that person was, and almost wanted to go to them and say, it's Depp.
