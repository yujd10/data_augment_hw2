I started to agree: the great filmmakers have been great since their beginnings. The creepy psychological film is the most modern in Jin Min's series of works. The style of painting is not yet crazy and haunted at the end of his career, but imagination and expressiveness (change of montage) have gone into an uninhabited land. Changing the point of view makes the audience feel the same way, so they cannot distinguish between reality and fantasy.
