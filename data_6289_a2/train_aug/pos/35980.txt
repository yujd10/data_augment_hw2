Yuanzi Wen tells a postmodern story about the fate of humanity with a retro texture of the old school. The sound design is very clear. For the first time, he saw a director use sound effects to express the concepts of "speed" and "stilness". Quiet, silent and silent, these abstract concepts break sensory barriers and create a kind of artistic pleasure synesthesia under the action of soundtrack and ambient sound.
