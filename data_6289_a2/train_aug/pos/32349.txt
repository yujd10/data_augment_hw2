At first, I didn't understand why pigs were the smartest and they were the leaders, but later I found it ironic. A pig is a pig, and the nature of being gluttonous and lazy will not change. The rules seem to be for the rulers, and they proclaim that all animals are equal. However, for profit, the leaders made friends with the "bad guys" they hated, and they began to crack down on the lower animals and began to crush and kill in the so-called equal mansion. Another bloody revolution started. When a man is a slave, tens of thousands of people will rise. In the class system, equality can never exist, but the spirit of pursuit of freedom and equality will last forever.
