The three values are very positive and the jokes are very cold! The film criticizes briefly but obviously totalitarianism and anarchism, and at the same time vaguely criticizes the propaganda of the mass media and the organization and mobilization of group; but the final goal is the understanding of the family, the father and the son love and break the model of the main melodic rhythm, and there is no sense of disobedience, it is the book of competence! It is so well written, it must be praised!
