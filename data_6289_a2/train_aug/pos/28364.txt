I've always been reluctant to watch movies about animals, but I was afraid I couldn't stand it emotionally and couldn't come out. I accepted this film because of my slightly rough paranoia towards Americans and Asians, and I adjusted my busy and depressed week with ease and pleasure, but I didn't know that I was still crying at the end of the film. I couldn't help myself. Unlike other dog descriptions, the whole story has no special powers, no empathy, no sacrifice to save others, and no psychic consideration and concern for human beings. On the contrary, it's malicious and malicious.
