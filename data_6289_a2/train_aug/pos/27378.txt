"I am a legend" is another moving film, which is heavier than "Dawn of the living Dead". I can't help but think that if one day everyone around me will die or become zombies, leaving you alone in the sterile city during the day, looking for food and supplies, listening to zombie screams after sunset and going to sleep, day after day, when it will end. After the dog's death, the man also abandoned hope, but fortunately the woman appeared in time to save the situation.
