Under the cruel social and historical oppression, there is only impotence in personal destiny, and there is ignorance in goodness, but it is not ignorance at that time, but it is only a sort of collective unconsciousness. Chinese peasants, bitter and kind, were good to make fun of themselves in the midst of trials and survival in this era of war, as well as in this so-called strong time. We do not agree that some say that the film is about the ignorance of farmers. Now, we look at them with the eyes of God and we sympathize with them, but now we, the people whose social class in China, can escape from the eyes that look and watch us. We can also be sympathised and laughed, and we have never escaped ignorance and we have fun in bitterness.
