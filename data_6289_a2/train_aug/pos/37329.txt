This short story describes a small utopian society built by the children of a rich family in the agitated periods of the disease. And this small society was finally invaded by the Red Dead, and the dignitaries and aristocrats inside have finally suffered the same terminal disease as the lower classes outside of the small society. In my initial idea, the seven colors used in the inner chambers of this small castle built by the rich represent the seven mortal sins of humanity, namely, arrogance, jealousy, rage, laziness, greed, gluttony and lust. But after reading a deeper interpretation, I think that the arrangement of the rooms from east to west represents the rising and sunset of the sun, and seven colors represent different stages of people's age, from childhood to youth to advanced age. This also explains why our protagonist drove the Red Dead from the first room to the last room before he was killed by the Red Dead.
