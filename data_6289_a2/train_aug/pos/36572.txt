First of all, serious: rich music, rich dances, points of laughter and tears, it was really a wonderful performance, crying silently several times in the middle, I don't know why it can especially get the suffering of artists. Besides, it's not serious: it seems to be mistakenly involved in meeting male fans (and it's believed that it's probably a rotten girl fan cp), there's a deleted cry from the female audience at the bottom of the mouth, but the male second is really very much getting. I'm also surrounded by fans ~ the lady held by him probably can't sleep tonight ~ and it's really a very high call ~ live performance really needs a warm response from the audience to be fun.
