DC's most powerful film. The point of violence is ahead of time, and almost all the characters are displaced, and this one can also explain some of the subsequent conspiracies, like the clown escaping in decency in the opposite world of the parallel universe. Professor Jigeng is absolutely right at the end, you beat the wings of the butterfly effect, and I, as a villain, have to endure all this and become a curse? This film can also be considered as a reversal for some second-class protagonists in the Justice League.
