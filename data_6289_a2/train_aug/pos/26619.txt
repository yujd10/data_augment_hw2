Four and a half stars. What a wonderful affection! For the boy, the bomb is a hope, the little boy on the pot is a good friend, and the occasional text message of the bottle is the strength to support it. For a girl who hasn't left home for three years, shooting at the moon is her romantic interest, and the anti-aircraft performance is her favorite time, when people stop and the world seems empty.
