A very stylish film. Godal is simply writing a poem with an objective, and even if the story is read in a fog, it is difficult to understand its true meaning. It is also excellent to appreciate the mirror simply as a photography manual. The frame of a happy ending does not feel good for the tone of the film, but it warms the heart.
