Also known as dizziness, just like the speckled color of the image, the case is complicated and confused, making people feel dizzy. Eighty minutes later, the 128-minute film entered the routine of "playing in the room". A dream is used as a dividing line, and the color is boldly used in the dream, recalling the urn in the shadow of Akira Kurosawa Samurai. Godal's "Madman Pierrot" also has a gradient of color in the horizontal lens. The narrative is accurate and too natural. Hitchcock is completely denied the 80-minute preliminary and he starts all over again, and a great plot gradually arrives at the surface. Change the general tone of the first half, which is slightly stable, and place it abruptly. The forehead is "illusory", and the second half is "true", and it is also true and illusory. The film shows a feeling of blurred texture, closing between reality and dreams.
