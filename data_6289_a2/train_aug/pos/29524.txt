In the most fruitful collection of poems, "there is always the densest blue in the night sky", there is a positive, intrepid and ascending chivalry, but "empathy" leads him to limit the romantic condescending expression. The author recovers to the original state of nothing, and announces the death of love again and again in this "philharmonic city". Therefore, the night sky of the city can no longer see the maximum density of the blue, and there is only infinite loss, blind obedience and reverence under the vertiginous lights of the neon. The only hope in a lifeless life is the poetesse standing in the street shouting applause to the "living". Unfortunately, love in the lower world has gradually degenerated into a kind of pessimism and superstition-proletarians does not have the right to speak of love at all, and only "active people" are qualified to say "you loved".
