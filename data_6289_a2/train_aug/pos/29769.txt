The first half is funny, and the second part is deep, which is really a good film by Alpacino, but in my opinion it is not as good as the Godfather, in which he is a winner, and in this he is a loser, two completely different types of people, but he is played alive by him. This film teaches us that to defeat those in power, we can only drag them into the vast sea of people's war.
