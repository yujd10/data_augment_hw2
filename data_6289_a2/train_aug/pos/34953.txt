When I woke up the next morning, some of the scenes of the film persisted and became clearer. When I think of all kinds of people in the village of the city, what comes to mind is that "all living beings suffer", just like the feeling of going to Zhanshan's beautiful house on the first day of the lunar new year to see animated people worship the Buddha. The man who makes people feel compassion, the woman who makes people respect. The last song makes people cry. There is a visual impact, a spiritual shock, and some places can smile. It is a very good film.
