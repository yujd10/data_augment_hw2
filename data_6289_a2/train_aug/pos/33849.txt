The characterization is full enough, and every detail is very moving. Norman looks like lana del Rey ~ Peter is so suitable to play the role of Paul that he was born with some sort of prodigy air and don't live. The question is why Paul is so upset every time he hears Norman mention something about Jesse. Is it true that Paul loves Jesse in the original book? Paul and Jesse are both unruly people, so it's not surprising if they do.
