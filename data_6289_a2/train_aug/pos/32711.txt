"the good things are always ephemeral, and memory is based on experience, so it inevitably loses its original color. Maybe the greatest pain in life is not that you can't see the beautiful things, but that you can't stand the disgusting things after seeing them. When you meet someone or something, you've predicted the pain of separation, so you have to be in love with something."
