The scene of the monastery wearing a wedding dress was wonderful! The Nazis were a little uncomfortable with the transition of marriage, but they really could not think of a better way. It is precisely because of the historical blessing that this film is exceptional, so this scene cannot be removed. There is no confusion between good and evil and emotional purity in the film (it is therefore a very "pure" film).
