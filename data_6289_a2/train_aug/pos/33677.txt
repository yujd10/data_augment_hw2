A wonderful film, the story takes place in a small studio, i.e., the representation of a radio play, can continue to have problems, each problem is also full of humor, and finally push the story to an impasse. And lead the film to the best part. There is almost nothing strange in the whole story, and the personality of each character is numbed by a limited performance. It is really a very happy job.
