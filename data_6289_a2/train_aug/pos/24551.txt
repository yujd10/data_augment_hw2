I do not miss a five star. The soundtrack is very appropriate. I still like to consider the story of Joan of Arc as a wonderful play. In the face of all the traps, Joan relied on her own beliefs (perhaps ultimate mastery) to solve them all. Since I saw Bernard Shaw, I have been extremely sympathetic to these priests of God in heresy. They are full of mercy and cruelty.
