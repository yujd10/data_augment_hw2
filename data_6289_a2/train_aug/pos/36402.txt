The city of God, the land without divinity abandoned by God, the true hell on earth. There, the children steal, steal, sell drugs and kill each other to fight violence. Murder is an instinct, a pleasure, a proud show capital. The vain attempt to become the master of God, like the replacement of running water, has finally been lost in this mad party. What remains unchanged is the idea eroded by the system, the broken moral code and the fate of death, whether to escape or resist.
