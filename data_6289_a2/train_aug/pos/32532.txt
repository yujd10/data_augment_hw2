Very Hitchcock! For the first time, I was afraid of an old movie from the 50s and 60s. I can't believe there are so many skills to use! The landscape is beautiful, Novak is even more beautiful! Novak's scene throwing flowers on San Francisco beach is constantly running in my mind, it's really beautiful!
