I saw an impressive comedy a long time ago, and the plot of the sudden death of heaven and earth has always been recalled, so it took three days to download the film again. I do not understand why this film is so low, so hit the five stars and shoot it a bit. Wei Jiahui put a lot of philosophical thought in this comedy, and the last words of the three people who intersected in India were also thought-provoking, and Ying Caier's emotional piece was also very touching.
