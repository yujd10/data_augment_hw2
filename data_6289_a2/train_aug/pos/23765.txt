Shakespeare's drama was put on the screen in the 1940s, and the treatment of audiovisual technology has not lost the charm of the original work. The extremely intense style of the drama, the poetic lines, the vocabulary of performance between the two arts, push-pull photography and changing techniques, and the programming of the scene with a rich spatial expression, all have reached its absolutely classical status as literary film. Lawrence Oliver is brilliant, has a deep accumulation of learning, and has a first-class performance of both writers and directors.
