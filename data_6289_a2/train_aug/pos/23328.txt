From a technical point of view, there is no doubt that the film was well ahead of Guoman (including Hong Kong Man) at that time, a large number of action scenes and the interaction between the characters and the scenes are very incredible. Unfortunately, the story is still difficult to manage, wandering between restoration and originality, which is not only hated by the original party, but also intelligible for the newcomers.
