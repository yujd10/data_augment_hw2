I went to Tsai Tsai, but I didn't expect to see Wu Zun, saying I knew the injured egg as soon as I saw it (fans, don't shoot me, that's a fact, his Sword Butterfly really took my break for many years). In fact, all the actors are very good, the script is a little hard at the end, but the characterization is really good.
