In New York, Uncle Fried Chicken was so beautiful when he was young. He had no idea that he was cute, impatient and a little stupid. Paris, I really think the blind sister is very cool. Rome, talking sunglasses, you refresh my point of view on this. Helsinki finally sat in the snow and seemed so helpless. A group of ordinary people can no longer be ordinary, in the words of meeting in the middle of the night, flashing alone, beautiful, warm and bright light.
